Openscapes Reflections is an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research.
:::

We know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved or continue building habits to support yourself and your colleagues. Weâ€™ve designed the Reflections Program to meet this need; Reflections is a 3-week program modeled from leadership coaching, something now core to the Openscapes approach.

We launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in May!
