**We communicate impact through stories of skill building, mindset shifts, and culture change**

> “To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver”.  
- Ayana Elizabeth Johnson & Katharine Wilkinson, All We Can Save

We are inspired by many movements, including climate and social justice movements. These impacts aren’t easily measured and that’s ok. We communicate impact through stories first, then numbers.

## STORIES

We see impact happening in small and big ways that combine and grow as part of the [flywheel](approach.qmd#openscapes-flywheel). This happens as people feel empowered in their own work and then stepping up to support others. We're seeing people build skills, reuse what works, and change their trajectories. 

We see this on daily basis in research: [TODO CONNECT to Champions/Pathways page and/or blog posts]

> "I didn't know open science was for me, but now I'm excited"

> "That keyboard shortcut is my go-to, it saves me so much time"

We're seeing people shift workflows and teach others [TODO CONNECT to Mentors page and/or blog posts]

> “I never thought I could learn GitHub, but I did, and I've also taught my boss”

> "My team has saved 400 would-be emails in 4 months”

We're seeing improved morale and people leveling up in new leadership roles [TODO CONNECT to Champions page and/or blog posts]

> "I got promoted and introduce live Google Docing agendas for all our director meetings"

> "I’m staying in the job because of Openscapes”

We're seeing large-scale culture shift, building from many years of community building and technical expertise 

> "The impact Openscapes has had in the last two years is unprecedented at NASA"

## BY THE NUMBERS

Numbers also help communicate the growing movement.

From 2018-2022 we've led 18 Champions Cohorts —
