**We communicate impact through stories of skill building, mindset shifts, and culture change that strengthen teamwork for data-intensive environmental science**
:::

<br>


We are inspired by many movements, including climate and social justice movements. These impacts aren’t easily measured and that’s ok. We communicate impact through stories first, then numbers.

> “To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver”.  
- **Ayana Elizabeth Johnson & Katharine Wilkinson, All We Can Save**

## STORIES

We see impact happening in small and big ways that combine and grow like the [flywheel](approach.qmd#openscapes-flywheel). This happens as people feel empowered in their own work and then also support others. We're seeing people build skills, reuse what works, and change their trajectories from participants across [our initiatives](initiatives.qmd), and amplify them through our [blog](blog.qmd) and in presentations on our [media page](media.qmd), including: 

- [NASA Openscapes: Movement building with the Flywheel](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BK678MADRg6QkejRQI_5KREGn6DzzQqAS4StsjXmi-k/edit#slide=id.g1b5922f14f8_0_83) - March 31, 2023, Erin Robinson & Julie Lowndes
- [Openscapes: supporting kinder science for future us](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WzNaQWVBTLSq4IX0GkvGlQWbDJ4isVpSvGnjb_rdEKU/edit?usp=sharing) - March 31, 2023 — Julie Lowndes & Ileana Fenwick

**We see shifts on daily basis in research:**

> "I didn't know open science was for me, but now I'm excited" - Pathways participant

> "That keyboard shortcut is my go-to, it saves me so much time" - Champion

<br>

**We're seeing people shift workflows and teach others:**  

> “I never thought I could learn GitHub, but I did, and I've also taught my boss” - Mentor 

> "My team has saved 400 would-be emails in 4 months” - Champion

<br>

**We're seeing improved morale and people leveling up in new leadership roles:** 

> "I got promoted and introduce live Google Docing agendas for all our director meetings" - Mentor

> "I’m staying in the job because of Openscapes” - Champion

<br>

**We're seeing large-scale culture shift, building from many years of community building and technical expertise:** 

> "The impact Openscapes has had in the last two years is unprecedented at NASA" - Mentor partner

## BY THE NUMBERS

Numbers also help communicate the growing movement.
