<span class="bold700">Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.</span> We support researchers to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. We work with academic, government, and non-profit research teams who become part of the open science movement as Champions empowered with new skill-sets and mindsets for modern data-intensive science. Learn these Champions’ stories through our [blog](), [media](), as well as steps for you to [supercharge your research]().
