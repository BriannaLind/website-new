*From June 4-5 2024, we are at the National Libraries of Medicine (NLM), part of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are writing this live from the front of the room! This is a brief note about this workshop, with more contributions and summaries to come.* 

## Designing an open science conversation

The NLM Workshop on advancing a networked approach to equitable open science is co-led by Maryam Zaringhalam and Lisa Federer, with us, Liz Neeley and Julie Lowndes as co-chairs. We convened a small group of open science and knowledge translators to share, learn from each other, and vision/plan next steps to support all of our ongoing work and how NLM can be a part of it. 

**Workshop [POP](https://suzannehawkes.com/2010/04/09/pop-everything/)**

- DAY 1 - BRAINSTORMING
  - Purpose: Explore: what are the ways in which our work in OS and KT complement and/or contrast with one another? How can we heighten those synergies and contrasts to identify areas for bridge building and collaboration to extend reach?
  - Outcome: Have a better sense for who we all are and where we sit in the OS and KT ecosystem
  - Process: Collaborative small group work and large group interactive brainstorming
- DAY 2 - SYNTHESIS
  - Purpose: Explore: what are opportunities to build out collaborations, networks, and feedback loops? How do we prioritize these opportunities? What does success look like?
  - Outcome: Prioritize future directions for NLM (and the communities you represent) and co-create a vision for success for equitable open science
  - Process: Large group discussions that build on our brainstorming and findings from day 1

We opened the workshop with some short stories and framing about what open science means to us and looks like to us - aiming to balance the broadness of open science with specficity (something to hold on to). Our [opening slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A7ytF_Ogqv6anEWsuSAmLk31_pTr8h7mf3oR9n_z2kc/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g2e1cac7edde_4_1) shared about our origins as marine scientists with the [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) (which is one of the shining examples what a [path to open data science](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28812630/) can look like) and how we work now through [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org/) and [Liminal](https://www.liminalcreations.com/). Then, we faciliated small group and full group conversations for folks to situating ourselves and each other in the open science and knowledge translation landscape. 

The conversations are still ongoing, stay tuned for more followup!
