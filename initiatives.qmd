Our initiatives are all remote-by-design, for researchers and those who support research. 
 Welcome!

## CHAMPIONS PROGRAM

**Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.** It is a multi-month program that is designed to ignite incremental and sustainable change within research teams and beyond. It helps teams get their own work done, while building skills and community within the realities of scientists' busy schedules, varying expertise and needs.

This is our flagship program, for research teams. We work with partners to coordinate cohorts of ~7 research teams for their organizations. From 2019-2022 we have led 18 Champions Cohorts!

## MENTORS FRAMEWORK

**The Mentors Framework is a multi-year engine for culture change within organizations.** It is a creative approach co-developed with [Erin Robinson](https://erinrobinson.info/) that blends tech and community building and draws inspiration and skills from many places including mentoring, coaching, facilitating, art, open source, environment, inclusion, movements, and leaders we admire.

We began developing the Mentors Framework in 2021 in partnership with NASA Earthdata. We have also been informally growing the Mentors Framework with NOAA Fisheries and the California Water Boards and excited to expand what we are learning with other groups.

## PATHWAYS TO OPEN SCIENCE PROGRAM

**Pathways to Open Science is a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science.** It is led by [Ileana Fenwick](https://twitter.com/_ileanaf) of Openscapes in partnership with [Black in Marine Science (BIMS)](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/) and [Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS)](https://www.bweems.org/).

We launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in January-March.

## REFLECTIONS PROGRAM

**Openscapes Reflections is an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research.** We know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved or continue building habits to support yourself and your colleagues. Weâ€™ve designed the Reflections Program to meet this need; Reflections is a 3-week program modeled from leadership coaching, something now core to the Openscapes approach.

We launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in May!
