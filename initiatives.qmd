## CHAMPIONS PROGRAM

**Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.** It is a multi-month program that is designed to ignite incremental and sustainable change within research teams and beyond. It helps teams get their own work done, while building skills and community within the realities of scientists' busy schedules, varying expertise and needs.

This is our flagship program, and from 2019-2022 we have led 18 cohorts. We work with partners to coordinate cohorts of 5 to 7 research teams.

## NASA OPENSCAPES


**NASA Openscapes is a multi-year effort to develop a mentor community across NASA Earth science data centers to support researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud**. We approach this work as movement building, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time.

We began in 2021, and currently working with Mentors from 7 of the 12 NASA Earth science data centers.

## MENTORS FRAMEWORK

**The Mentors Framework is a multi-year engine for culture change within organizations.** It blends tech and community building through mentoring, coaching, facilitating, art, open source, environment, inclusion, movements, and leaders we admire.

<!---The Framework involves connecting open leaders with each other and leadership and includes regular peer-learning meetings and formal skillbuilding in teaching and coaching. --->

We began developing the Mentors Framework in 2021 through NASA Openscapes. We have also been growing the Mentors Framework with NOAA Fisheries, the California Water Boards, and Pathways to Open Science teams and are excited to expand what we are learning with other groups.

## PATHWAYS TO OPEN SCIENCE PROGRAM

**Pathways to Open Science is an event series for Black environmental & marine researchers.** It is led by [Ileana Fenwick](team.qmd) of Openscapes in partnership with [Black in Marine Science (BIMS)](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/) and [Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS)](https://www.bweems.org/), focused on building community for the future of data-intensive science.

We launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in January-March.

## REFLECTIONS PROGRAM

**Openscapes Reflections is an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research.** We know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved or continue building habits to support yourself and your colleagues. Weâ€™ve designed the Reflections Program to meet this need; Reflections is a 3-week program modeled from leadership coaching, something now core to the Openscapes approach.

We launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in May!
