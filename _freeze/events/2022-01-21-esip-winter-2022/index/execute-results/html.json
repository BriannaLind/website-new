We aim to support open practices and community building that accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. Researchers and researcher support staff from NOAA Fisheries, California EPA, and NASA Openscapes (LP DAAC, NSIDC) will share vignettes  about open science in government and how we can support and connect open science work sna strengthen channels for inter- and cross-agency learning as we prepare for the Year of Open Science 2023. \n\n**<https://2022esipjanuarymeeting.sched.com/event/qkp5/better-science-for-future-us-planning-for-the-year-of-open-science>**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" preview='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](esip-logo.png){fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n",
