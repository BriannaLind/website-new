Having science be not only more transparent and reproducible but also more kind and inclusive is a huge part of what Openscapes is working towards. \n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../images/banner_imgs/original_banners/horst_openscapes_desert_1500px.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Partial rear view of a monster with image focusing on their safety harness with a GitHub Octocat logo, chalk bag, carabiners, and rope.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.center-text}\nArt by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)\n:::\n\n<!-- <br>  -->\n<!-- <center> -->\n<!--   <a><img src=\"/img/horst_openscapes_desert_1500px.png\" width=\"700px\"></a> -->\n<!--   <figcaption>Art by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)</figcaption> -->\n<!-- </center>   -->\n\n<br>\n\n> Open science is not just about improving the way we share data and methods; it is also about improving the way we think, work and interact with each other. It’s about technology enabling social infrastructure that can promote inclusivity to create kinder science. \n\n<br>\n\nI have been thinking about \"kinder science\" a lot, and am still working on how to talk about it, and am so grateful for the opportunity to share these thoughts in *Scientific American*. The article pulls from ideas we cover in the [Champions program](/champions) and from recent talks at\n[useR!](/blog/2019/08/22/user-keynote/), [FORCE 11](https://zenodo.org/record/3497306#.Xbs3WSV7nOQ), and [eScience](https://openscapes.github.io/slides/betterscience/escience#1). I've got several more upcoming talks and will continue to build out these ideas — keep an eye on the [media page](/media) for those slide decks. Thanks for the feedback and discussions so far on Twitter (particularly [here](https://twitter.com/juliesquid/status/1204460342333468672) and [here](https://twitter.com/nceas/status/1204446929981063169)).\n\n\"Open software means kinder science\" is also cross-posted as [an NCEAS commentary](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/open-science-kinder-science): \"Open science is kinder science\". \n\n\n\n<!---\n\nThis is really important, because working with data all day without being trained and supported isa demoralizing and lonely experience, that means scientists spend a good chunk of time feeling deflated and isolated. That is not how science is supposed to be, how innovation is supposed to happen! \n\nOpen software can bring people together and make them feel empowered\n\nThis is why I love the storytelling with Star Wars that were part of [my useR! keynote](/blog/2019/08/22/user-keynote/) this summer — we can emphasize with how Luke Skywalker feels when he has crashed his plane on Degabah. And we understand how empowered he feels when he learns the Force. \n\nEpathizing with scientists is a critical part of the open science movement. \n\nI've been feeling and thinking about kinder science a lot but have only recently gotten bolder saying this out loud, because it can sound a bit strange. But I've found — from my own lived experience and through teaching and mentoring others — that an important step to participating in open science is to . And that's about how it makes people feel as a human being as well as what it enables them to do. And how it can make them feel is awesome. \n \nBut it's something I've started feeling more confident talking about, having spent time not only with the #rstats communities but also with open communities like Mozilla and FORCE. And it comes down to this: People get jazzed about open data science when we we talk about how awesome and empowering it makes you feel. \n\n\n\nincludes some things I've been thinking about and have started including in presentations: \n\nOpen science is not just about improving the way we share data and methods; it is also about improving the way we think, work and interact with each other. It’s about technology enabling social infrastructure that can promote inclusivity to create kinder science. \n\nKindness : getting bolder\n\nKicking  a lot of these ideas around for awhile. \n\ndemoralizing and lonely analyses don't make for happy and innovative scientists\n\n--->\n\n<br> \n\n\n",
