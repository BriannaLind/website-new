<p><em>Last week I’ve been at #PositConf2023 in Chicago, reconnecting with the open data science community through folks from RLadies, Posit, and the greater #rstats and python community. I gave a talk, sharing about documenting things and how intentional approaches is helping teams tackle hard challenges and change organizational culture. This post is a light debrief of highlights from the Conference, as well as a short overview of my talk.</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="posit-conf-2023---go-tell-your-room-mate">Posit Conf 2023 - Go tell your room mate</h2>
<p>When we debrief following Openscapes events, we try to capture one thing that we would go tell our housemate/roommate (we developed this working from home during the pandemic; it could also be your coworker or the first person nearby). These “go tell your roommate” debriefs are often not a summary or synthesis, but a moment or detail or feeling that really stands out that. A little micro-story we can amplify. So here are some of these “housemate moments” from Posit conf that I wanted to share.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="penobscot-indian-nation-opening-video">Penobscot Indian Nation opening video</h3>
<p>The whole conference kicked off with a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hewardt_positconf2023-activity-7110020014442733569-YbLF"><strong>beautiful and inspiring video</strong></a> with the Penobscot Indian Nation. It was narrated by Jan Paul and told the story of the pollution of the Penobscot River and how water quality monitoring and data analysis by Jan and her colleagues are helping turn this around. Seeing this as the kick-off for the conference and meeting Jan was a highlight of the whole conference. I also met her colleague Angie Reed in person - Angie was a <a href="https://openscapes.org/blog/2021-07-13-css-cohort/">2021 Openscapes Champion</a> with the Tribes and the Exchange Network team - and this group is looking for folks to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHj47P0OAbPunyP6zbIihVeOOthiKsrCXWXoUQym_v9XdUog/viewform">sign up</a> to support with R/Python.</p>

<section id="rladies-community" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rladies-community">RLadies community</h3>
<p>One of my absolute favorite talks was by Riva Quiroga: <strong>Sustainable Growth of Global Communities: R-Ladies’ Next Ten Years</strong>. Riva shared the story of how a large global community has changed its leadership seamlessly and inclusively with deep thought and intention. As part of this, they upgraded their membership system in a cost-effective and code-forward approach, while continuing to support the community throughout. They shared how the transition from manually entering member bios for the website from a Google Form to switching to AirTable that automatically updates the website using a scheduled cron job and GitHub Action was very interesting to me, and something we can learn from.</p>
<p>R Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. One way I have felt this is when RLadies band together to sit in front rows of each others’ talks, and if there is ever a question of which talk to go to, you choose an RLadies talk and support them for being there. RLadies has not only changed individual lives and career paths but the R community as a whole. I spoke with several people who this was their first Posit Conf who commented how many women were at a tech conference – and how connected they were. That doesn’t happen by accident - that is the result of the unrelenting and huge amount of work that many awesome women and gender minorities in the R community, and so many awesome allies and supporters from every aspect. This includes Posit, who pays for the room for us to all gather at the end of the conference. I am so proud to be a part of RLadies, and want to increase my involvement since I and the other co-founders of our RLadies Santa Barbara Chapter passed leadership in early 2020.</p>
<p>I really appreciated talking with <a href="https://silviacanelon.com/">Silvia Canelón</a> and <a href="https://milliesymns.com/">Millie Symns</a> throughout the conference. Millie gave a fantastic talk about her journey becoming an observer to contributor in her talk <a href="https://milliesymns.com/talk/positconf_2023/">Side effects of blogging for a year</a>. Hannah Frick is always a fave person to see, and is part has been part of the RLadies’ global leadership for a long time. I also really liked Liz Roten’s talk “There is an I in Team”, sharing how to onboard folks to your data science team and shared workflows. There were many other great talks by RLadies that I saw throughout the week and am excited to watch the ones I missed, including SherAaron Hurt from the Carpentries’s R you Ready! talk.</p>

<section id="quarto-features-and-partnerships" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quarto-features-and-partnerships">Quarto features and partnerships</h3>
<p>There are new exciting features and partnerships with Quarto!</p>
<p>Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel talked about <a href="https://mine.quarto.pub/manuscripts-conf23/">Reproducible manuscripts with Quarto</a> and a new partnership with the American Geophysical Union (AGU) to make this happen. This upends the idea that the PDF is the main element for publishing: it’s: “an end-to-end scholarly publishing workflow that treats Jupyter and Quarto notebooks as a primary element of the scientific record” and “A publication process that elevates transparent and reproducible work by authors, where data and software, together with narrative, are documented, shared, and archived.” Quarto can already use hypothesis.io for commenting, which helps you track-changes when collaborating in Quarto docs.</p>
<p>Charlotte Wickham shared about new features coming in the next Quarto release (by Christmas). I’m excited about code annotation, and embedding the output of one notebook into another (with provenance), and the JupyterLab extension that will help the NASA Mentors edit quarto documents in our 2i2c JupyterHub. I also spoke with J.J. Allaire and the Quarto developer team about some specific features that would help NASA Mentors build a single Quarto book with notebooks from multiple repositories, and our plan is to collaborate soon to make this happen, which is super awesome.</p>
<p>There is a lot of other great features and examples with Quarto that I will continue to learn about post conf.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="black-hair-and-data-science-have-more-in-common-than-you-think">Black Hair and Data Science Have More in Common Than You Think</h3>
<p>Kari Jordan is Executive Director of the Carpentries. Her talk about Black hair and data science have more in common than you think was really thought-provoking. Kari created a fabulous table categorizing hair type and data type and the tools and workflows required. I have a long way to learn from communities different from me, and I really appreciated this chance with Kari. This was an intimate and brave talk, one that Kari said she adapted for a Posit audience since she first gave it at Spelman College, a historically black liberal arts college for women in Atlanta, Georgia. I also loved that Kari’s niece attended sessions with Kari and Sher! throughout the week!</p>

<section id="webr-for-reproducibility-teaching" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="webr-for-reproducibility-teaching">webR for reproducibility &amp; teaching</h3>
<p>James Balamuta presented about webR, and demonstrated how “this approach can transform static Quarto documents into dynamic examples by leveraging webR’s capabilities through standard Quarto code cells, enabling real-time execution of R code and dynamic display of results. Our approach empowers educators and researchers alike to harness the power of interactivity and reproducibility for enhanced learning and research experiences.” James gave Eli Holmes from NOAA Fisheries a shoutout for her early feedback and testing, which delighted me.</p>

<section id="thoughtful-keynotes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thoughtful-keynotes">Thoughtful keynotes</h3>
<p>The keynotes this year were all really super.</p>
<p>Kara Woo gave a beautiful keynote, likening the walking through the halls as tending a garden, and shared how to take what we learn and feel through this garden back to our home places. One quote that stood out to me was that if you’re afraid of changing something cuz you think you might break something, it’s already broken</p>
<p>Jeremy Howard’s keynote was very interesting, all presented from a Jupiter notebook. I had listened to a conversation with Jeremy Howard and JJ Heller that I found really thought-provoking last year. And it’s interesting to see how these ideas look on a page</p>
<p>Elaine McVay shared cyclical process of getting by in as a data scientist, she shared about how many times data scientists are hired within a team but not given access to data and so building relationships and showing not telling is a big part of getting by in and being able to do the job.</p>
<p>Ted ladaris spoke about burnout experienced by community organizers, and how asking for help not taking it all on yourself and x or strategies for continuing to find joy and learning without burning out</p>
<p>Sean cross talked about the tiny data tutor that he developed to help visualize tinyverse operations, and he framed this in a bigger idea that code is data, which is something I’d never heard about before. Sean cross is such a hero of mine, one of the early friendly people that made me feel like I belonged in the our community, and I’m so thrilled to be working with him more now through kyber and through Fred hutch. It was wonderful to see him in person and he gave me a swirl sticker which I have coveted for a long time</p>
<p>So many hallway conversations and hugs. Davis Vaughn shared about updates to deplier, and found me early to ask if I needed any help with my slides. Davis has come to the rescue at both my corto and use our keynotes to help with sharingan and corto slide formatting in the last moment of need. So appreciate him and fun fact, we first met because he saw my computer with stickers in the airport in London and came to say hi</p>
<p>I love talking with Andy Tucker and stuff Haslett and learning about how their work is going after leaving industry jobs, Sierra Martinez it was a Mozilla fellow with me and I got to not only meet her toddler but talk to her about really big work in biodiversity that she’s doing,</p>
<p>No officeries Marine Mammal lab were there! This is a group I’ve worked with for years now and I remember first conversations with Josh London about how we could work together, and now it’s happening</p>
<p>I got to meet yanni in person! She is the community manager at Urban side, and on the leadership team of our Ladies and very active in the carpentries. We talked about how important it is to be active across these different communities and how we collaborate and not complete, and this is something that we will continue strengthening in the years to come. She talked about all of the amazing work that are open side champions are doing and package development, and that teams often want to join together to think about package maintenance as a team. I wonder if this will be something for the NASA and Noah mentors in the future.</p>

<section id="documenting-things" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="documenting-things">Documenting things</h2>
<p>The purpose of the talk was to give advice about how to document things effectively &amp; share stories of how documentation can be visible and valued — and help teams be efficient, productive, and less lonely. I presented this in 2 parts. First, a 5-min lightning talk with practical tips, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files#how-to-name-files">Jenny Bryan’s Naming Files</a> 💙; Jenny has been a huge teacher, inspiration, and role model of how to documenting things and share to support others, and this is an attempt to follow suit. Second: 10-min stories with repeatable strategies, from NASA Openscapes &amp; beyond. Something that is critical to all of this is to have technical and social infrastructure, i.e.&nbsp;time and support to write documentation as part of your job. There is a <a href="TODO EDITORIAL REF">TL;DR</a> in the form of a preprint editorial co-authored by Openscapes Mentors across NASA, NOAA, EPA, and academia.</p>
<p><strong>How to document things</strong></p>
