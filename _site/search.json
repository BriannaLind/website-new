Through the Champions program we help researchers move from lonely research to team science with community through exploring and navigating pathways together. Artwork by Allison Horst.\n\n\n\n\nPROGRAM DETAILS\n\nFor Openscapes at a glace, check out our overview slides.\nOpenscapes Champions is a multi-month program that is led remotely and designed to ignite incremental and sustainable change within research groups — and beyond. The program remotely convenes a cohort of science teams twice per month over two or four months for 1.5-hour video calls that we call Cohort Calls. This is not a workshop. The Champions program design is modeled after Mozilla Open Leaders, where small time requirements over longer time frames and participants focused on their existing work fosters incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientists’ busy schedules, varying expertise and needs.\nEach Cohort Call uses the Champions Lesson Series, which is an open curriculum originally based on what was instrumental in the Ocean Health Index (OHI) team’s path to better science in less time, and openly iterated as we experiment and learn. We start off each call with a reminder of our Code of Conduct and provide multiple channels for participation, including through silent contributions to the Google Doc Agenda, breakout groups, and full-group discussions. Each call closes with an efficiency tip and an inclusion tip to incorporate into daily practice.\nParticipants attend as teams, and come prepared for engaged participation as a whole cohort and within smaller breakout groups (as teams and mixed across teams). Discussions focus around collaborative mindsets, norms, and software to enable open, reproducible, inclusive research, introducing tools like R, tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, Google Drive, and Twitter and practices from open source communities, inclusive design, psychological safely, facilitation techniques, and examples from specific research domains including the OHI and previous Champions. Teams intentionally have a mix of data/coding experience and responsibilities; there are no coding prerequisites to participate.\nOpenscapes Champions program is designed so that everyone can learn new approaches and make progress, no matter where they are starting from. Each team creates a Pathway document to start thinking about where they are now in terms of the tools and practices for reproducibility, collaboration, communication, and culture. Throughout the Cohort, teams develop their Pathway to help identify, prioritize and articulate their needs and next steps. Pathway progress from each team is presented in the final session, which helps participants practice articulating their data workflow plans and needs, and see similarities and allies across the cohort to continue on these paths together.\nWith Cohort Calls occurring twice monthly on alternating weeks, the time in between each session enables participants to reflect and practice new concepts of immediate value to their own work while the Openscapes team incorporates feedback and iterates to better support cohort needs. One way we suggest reinforcing this reflection and practice is through a regular practice of separate team data-workflow meetings (we call “Seaside Chats”) in the alternating weeks between cohort calls. This gives them an opportunity to share their learning with their broader team or collaborators, to work on their Pathways with their teams and identify, discuss norms around data and code management and inclusive onboarding practices, and identify things they want to learn together and things they can teach each other.\nThe remote- and cohort-nature of the program is designed to reinforce each other’s learnings and networks across participating teams, with the purpose of empowering folks with open data science, and strengthening mindsets and habits to make data workflows and team culture more efficient and resilient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAMPIONS COHORTS\n\nExplore previous Openscapes Champions Cohorts to learn about these inspiring teams’ research and open data science momentum.\n\n“This program has honestly completely re-made how I think about my science. Openscapes is a supportive training course for moving your lab toward open science, that meets you where you are.” — Dr. Chelsea Wood, University of Washington\n\n\n“Openscapes has created a new way of thinking about merging empathy and science. That’s an invaluable gift to me.” — Dr. Halley Froehlich, University of California Santa\n\n\n“My group needs to collaborate better and [Openscapes] provided good exposure to tools and mindsets that facilitate open science.” - Lead at NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAMPIONS LESSON SERIES\n\nThe Openscapes Champions Program is strongly motivated by open data science, and with that comes the mindset of openness, collaboration, inclusion, trust, and creating the culture we want in science.\nThe Openscapes Champions Lessons Series is the core curriculum that we use in the Champions Program. It is iterated openly, with the most recent version always available online. Each Chapter has associated slides used in Cohort Calls, which we cover in Cohort Calls.\nThe Lesson Series is originally framed around the the tools and practices critical to the OHI team’s path to better science in less time, with examples from the open source programming language R and R communities. However, the concepts are relevant no matter the programming language, and we continually invest in this curriculum to incorporate examples from other languages and communities as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRESOURCES\n\nOur Resources page has some resources meant to welcome environmental scientists who are newly onboarding to open data science. We also have a public Openscapes Zotero library linking publications, talks, and curricula. Our Openscapes GitHub Organization has pinned repositories of interest, including the teaching-learning-resources repo where we use Issues to jot down specific tools or learning resources for open, reproducible, inclusive science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\nLearn more about how research groups participate in our Frequently Asked Questions."

    "text": "Openscapes is an approach for doing better science for future us.\n\n\nWe offer mentorship, teaching, coaching and community organizing centered around open data science: we help teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes story starts with file names like “data_analysis_final_v2b.xls” — you know the ones. It is a story about reimagining what’s possible when we modernize how we collaborate as part of the open movement.\nOpenscapes has been co-developed by Julia Lowndes and Erin Robinson, combining their expertise of open data science and open data stewardship, community and program building, teaching and coaching, as well as their lived experience as researchers. Together, they built the Openscapes as a value-based initiative that builds momentum like a flywheel and sustainably supports research teams with open science. With the Openscapes Champions flagship program and the first cohort of research teams, Openscapes was initially launched by Julia through a Mozilla Fellowship in 2018.\nErin joined in 2020 and together they created the Openscapes Framework that supports scaling Openscapes into a movement with the Openscapes mentor community. Openscapes mentors are people embedded in science organizations that learn to lead Openscapes Champions programs for their organization. This framework was developed through a NASA grant that Julia and Erin lead. Beyond NASA, the Framework has supported mentors at several other organizations like NOAA, and the California Water Boards.\nWe are excited to continue learning and iterating with the open movement towards kinder, better science for future us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn about our our team who are helping grow and improve Openscapes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a welcoming, safe, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nWe expect all participants to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which was influenced and adapted from rOpenSci and Mozilla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllison Horst creates original art for Openscapes, beginning as an artist in residence at NCEAS. Formerly an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California at Santa Barbara, currently a Data Scientist Advocate at Observable, Allison is also one of the inaugural Openscapes Champions. With a background in the fine arts, she also works digitally – explore her stats illustrations and follow her on Twitter.\nSee all of Allison’s open landscapes on the gallery page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur logo designed by Allison Horst represents both the open landscapes and the data within them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thank our funders for supporting open science tools, people, and communities. Openscapes was originally created with support from Mozilla, which also sponsored the first Champions Cohort. In 2019 we received additional support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to develop a strategic growth plan for Openscapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdated language here"
