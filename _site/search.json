    "text": "Last week I’ve been at #PositConf2023 in Chicago, reconnecting with the open data science community through folks from R-Ladies, Posit, and the greater #rstats and python community. I gave a talk, sharing about documenting things and how intentional approaches are helping teams tackle hard challenges and change organizational culture. This post is a light debrief of highlights from the Conference, as well as a short overview of my talk. Big disclaimer! There was way more awesomeness (both tech and people!) and this absolutely doesn’t capture it all. Definitely look out for other great talks about features and real-world teams using Shiny (with R and Python), tidyverse, Quarto, and much much more.\nQuick links:"

    "section": "posit::conf(2023) - Go tell your roommate",
    "text": "posit::conf(2023) - Go tell your roommate\nWhen we debrief following Openscapes events, we try to capture one thing that we would go tell our housemate/roommate (we developed this working from home during the pandemic; it could also be your coworker or the first person nearby). These “go tell your roommate” debriefs are often not a summary or synthesis, but moments or details or feelings that really stand out. They are little micro-stories we can amplify. So here are some of these “roommate moments” from posit::conf that I wanted to share.\n\nPenobscot Indian Nation opening video\nThe whole conference kicked off with a beautiful and inspiring video with the Penobscot Indian Nation. It was narrated by Jan Paul and told the story of the pollution of the Penobscot River and how water quality monitoring and data analysis by Jan and her colleagues are helping turn this around. Seeing this as the kick-off for the conference and meeting Jan was a highlight of the whole conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posit::conf stage with Hadley Wickham showing thanks to Jan Paul, Angie Reed & the Penobscot Indian Nation for the conference kickoff\n\nI also met Jan Paul’s colleague Angie Reed in person (!!!); Angie was a 2021 Openscapes Champion with the Tribes and the Exchange Network team and doing big work around data science skills across Tribes. (We met because Ben Marwick specifically connected us; I know Ben through rOpenSci). The Tribal Exchange Network is looking for folks to sign up and help this community with R/Python support!\n\n\nR-Ladies community\nOne of my absolute favorite talks was by Riva Quiroga: Sustainable Growth of Global Communities: R-Ladies’ Next Ten Years. Riva shared the story of how a large global community has changed its leadership seamlessly and inclusively with deep thought and intention. As part of this, they upgraded their membership system in a cost-effective and code-forward approach, while continuing to support the community throughout. They shared how the transition from manually entering member bios for the website from a Google Form to switching to Airtable that automatically updates the website using a scheduled cron job and GitHub Action was very interesting to me, and something we can learn from.\nR-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. One way I have felt this is when R-Ladies band together to sit in the front rows of each others’ talks, and if there is ever a question of which talk to go to, you choose an R-Ladies talk and support them for being there. R-Ladies has not only changed individual lives and career paths but the R community as a whole. I really liked when Mo Mowinckel emphasized this at the RLadies Global Meetup on Thursday.\nI spoke with several people for whom this was their first posit::conf who commented how many women were at a tech conference – and how connected they were. That doesn’t happen by accident - that is the result of the unrelenting and huge amount of work of many awesome women and gender minorities in the R community, and so many awesome allies and supporters from every aspect. This includes Posit, who pays for the room for us to all gather at the end of the conference (and supported all 5 people from RLadies Leadership to be in the same place for the first time - see DrMowinckel’s post! I am so proud to be a part of R-Ladies, and want to increase my involvement since I and the other co-founders of our R-Ladies Santa Barbara Chapter passed on to new leadership in early 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfie: Deepsha Menghani, Julie Lowndes, Yanina Bellini Saibene\n\nI got to meet Yanina Bellini Saibene in person! Yani is the Community Manager at rOpenSci, and on the leadership team of R-Ladies and The Carpentries. We talked about how important it is to be active across these different communities and how we collaborate and not complete, and this is something that we will continue strengthening in the years to come. She talked about all of the amazing R packages that rOpenSci Champions are developing, and that teams often want to join together as Champions to think about package maintenance as a team. I wonder if this will be something for the NASA- and NOAA-Openscapes teams in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfie: Monica Gerber, Julie Lowndes, Hannah Frick\n\nI really appreciated talking with Silvia Canelón and Millie Symns throughout the conference. Millie gave a fantastic talk about her journey from becoming an observer to contributor in her talk Side effects of blogging for a year. Hannah Frick is always a fave person to see, and has been part of the R-Ladies’ global leadership for a long time. I’m excited to hear more about her work with LatinR and more; she chaired several sessions and we had brief hi’s in between.\nI also really liked Liz Roten’s talk “There is an I in Team”, sharing how to onboard folks to your data science team and shared workflows. There were many other great talks by R-Ladies that I saw throughout the week and am excited to watch the ones I missed, including SherAaron Hurt from the Carpentries’s R you Ready! talk.\n\n\nQuarto features and partnerships\nThere are new exciting features and partnerships with Quarto!\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel talked about Reproducible manuscripts with Quarto and a new partnership with the American Geophysical Union (AGU) to make this happen. This upends the idea that the PDF is the main element for publishing: it’s: “an end-to-end scholarly publishing workflow that treats Jupyter and Quarto notebooks as a primary element of the scientific record” and “A publication process that elevates transparent and reproducible work by authors, where data and software, together with narrative, are documented, shared, and archived.” Quarto can already use hypothesis.io for commenting, which helps you track-changes when collaborating in Quarto docs.\nCharlotte Wickham shared about new features coming in the next Quarto release (by Christmas). I’m excited about code annotation, and embedding the output of one notebook into another (with provenance), and the JupyterLab extension that will help the NASA Mentors edit Quarto documents in our 2i2c JupyterHub. I also spoke with J.J. Allaire and the Quarto developer team about some specific features that would help NASA Openscapes Mentors build a single Quarto book with notebooks from multiple repositories, and our plan is to collaborate soon to make this happen, which is super awesome.\nThere are a lot of other great features and examples with Quarto that I will continue to learn about post conf.\n\n\nBlack hair and data science have more in common than you think\nKari Jordan is Executive Director of The Carpentries. Her talk about Black hair and data science have more in common than you think was really thought-provoking. Kari created a fabulous table categorizing hair type and data type and the tools and workflows required. I have a long way to learn from communities of people who are different from me, and I really appreciated this chance with Kari. This was an intimate and brave talk, one that Kari said she adapted for a Posit audience since she first gave it at Spelman College, a historically Black liberal arts college for women in Atlanta, Georgia. I also loved that Kari’s niece attended sessions with Kari and Sher! throughout the week!\n\n\nwebR for reproducibility & teaching\nJames Balamuta presented about webR, and demonstrated how “this approach can transform static Quarto documents into dynamic examples by leveraging webR’s capabilities through standard Quarto code cells, enabling real-time execution of R code and dynamic display of results. Our approach empowers educators and researchers alike to harness the power of interactivity and reproducibility for enhanced learning and research experiences.” James gave Eli Holmes from NOAA Fisheries a shoutout for her early feedback and testing, which delighted me.\n\n\nShow, don’t tell\nThe keynotes this year were all really super. I’m going to focus on two:\nElaine McVey emphasized “show, don’t tell” as a strategy for getting buy-in for what you need as a data scientist. She walked through it as a cyclical process, sharing how often data scientists are hired within a team but not given access to data to do their jobs. Building relationships to understand how things work and to build trust is part of everyone being able to do their jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElaine McVey’s cyclical process emphasizing a “show, don’t tell” strategy\n\nKara Woo gave a beautiful keynote, likening the walking through the halls as tending a garden, and shared how to take what we learn and feel through this garden back to our home places. One quote that stood out to me was “if you can’t make changes because you’re afraid of breaking something, it’s already broken”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKara Woo giving her keynote\n\nAmelia McNamara, Hannah Frick, Sean Kross, Hadley Wickham and I had a mini #rstats nerd huddle between excellent keynotes by Kara Woo and JD Long:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfie: Julie Lowndes, Hadley Wickham, Sean Kross, Hannah Frick, Amelia McNamara\n\n\n\nNOAA Fisheries and Fred Hutch Cancer Center\nSean Kross is a Data Staff Scientist at the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab. His talk was about the Tidy Data Tutor that he developed to help visualize tidyverse operations. He framed this in a bigger idea that code is data, which is something I’d never heard about before. Holy Moly Sean, Tidy Data Tutor has 50K users across 150 countries! And this growth is over maybe 2 years? Amazing. And speaks to its usefulness. Also, this paper Tools for Analyzing R Code the Tidy Way by Sean, Jeff Leek, and Lucy D’Agostino McGowan is now on my list to read! Sean Kross is such a hero of mine, one of the early friendly people that made me feel like I belonged in the R community, and I’m so thrilled that we’ve been collaborating for nearly 5 years. He was part of our very first Champions Cohort, when he was exploring studying Openscapes as part of his PhD. He has also built our kyber R package that automates a lot of our infrastructure to lead Champions Cohorts. And, now we’re leading the very first Champions Cohort at Fred Hutch, together with Stefanie Butland and Sean’s colleague (and R Lady) Monica Gerber. It was wonderful to see Sean and Monica in person! Sean also gave gave me a swirl sticker which I have coveted for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal Lab folks with Julie and Sean.\n\nAnd, folks from the NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal Lab were there! This is a group I’ve worked with for years now, and it was wonderful to meet in person. I remember first conversations with Josh London about how we could work together at previous RStudio conferences, and now it’s happening! We had dinner together with Sean Kross, which was awesome since all of them are based in Seattle.\n\n\nMuch much more.\nSo many hallway conversations and hugs. Davis Vaughn shared about updates to dplyr, and found me early at the Reception to ask if I needed any help with my slides. Davis has come to the rescue at both my RStudio and useR! keynotes to help with xaringan and Quarto slide sharing in the last moment of need. I so appreciate him! And fun fact: we first met because he saw my computer with stickers in the airport in London on our way to Toulouse in 2019 and came to say hi.\nTed Laderas spoke about burnout experienced by community organizers, which is real. He suggested asking for help and not taking it all on yourself as a few strategies to continue to find joy and learning with your community.\nI love talking with Andy Teucher and Steph Hazlitt and Nic Crane and learning about their work in and out of industry. And also Ciera Martinez, who was a Mozilla fellow with me and I got to not only meet her adorable toddler but also hear about really big work in biodiversity and data science that she’s doing from UC Berkeley.\nThere’s never enough time to talk to everyone and learn all the things, and that was certainly true this time. Looking forward to staying connected (seems like some combination of Mastodon & Bluesky) and seeing folks in Seattle in 2024!"

    "text": "Documenting things\nOK, a super-brief run-down of my talk:\nThe purpose of the talk was to give advice about how to document things effectively & share stories of how documentation can be visible and valued — and help teams be efficient, productive, and less lonely. I presented this in 2 parts. First, a 5-min lightning talk with practical tips, inspired by Jenny Bryan’s Naming Files 💙; Jenny has been a huge teacher, inspiration, and role model of how to document things and share to support others, and this is an attempt to follow suit. Second, 10-min of stories with reusable strategies, from NASA Openscapes & beyond. Something that is critical to all of this is to have technical and social infrastructure, i.e. time and support to write documentation as part of your job. There is a TL;DR in the form of a preprint editorial co-authored by Openscapes Mentors across NASA, NOAA, EPA, and academia.\nHow to document things\n Have a place\n Have an audience in mind\n Design for readability & accessibility\nWalk through my slides for the details and tips!\nStories\nI shared stories about growing the NASA Openscapes Mentors community, first focusing on how documenting things helped staff collaborate from across NASA Data Centers to co-develop teaching resources to support researchers using NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. This documentation helped onboard others as contributors in three ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide from my talk. NASA-Openscapes project website, Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, Openscapes Approach Guide.\n\nFurther, putting a focus on documentation has enabled NOAA Fisheries, California Water Boards, and others to reuse this approach. We wrote an editorial we have submitted to Nature sharing how this requires an investment in both technical and social infrastructure. We encourage making time and advocating for time to support each other in these efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide from my talk. Illustration by Adyan Rios and Su Kim, NOAA Fisheries.\n\n\nTogether with this awesome community we are building technical and social infrastructure that we can leverage to shift institutional culture and develop climate solutions with Open Science!"

Sign up to attend and get the Zoom link on the Carpentries Etherpad under Community Discussion Session, Exploring collaborations.\nThe Carpentries supports building capacity within organisations interested in teaching data science and coding skills to researchers. In turn, these organisations spread our mission and provide opportunities for collaboration across communities sharing common interests and values.\nIn this Community Discussion Session, connect with staff from NASA Earth Science, NASA DEVELOP and NASA Openscapes to learn how these organisations are currently engaging with The Carpentries, through workshops for coding skills and Instructor Training to bring teaching philosophies and leadership skills to new places to create new materials. We will explore how they, and like organisations, can work to build successful collaborations to support advancing open science practices.\nWe hope this session will begin to build a subcommunity of Carpentries Instructors connected through NASA TOPS, DEVELOP and NASA Openscapes. However, anyone interested in developing an engaged network of Instructors is welcome to attend.\nThis session will include panelists giving a brief overview of how they have been connecting with The Carpentries and a facilitated discussion.\nSpeakers:\n\nChris Battisto, NASA Openscapes & GES DISC (Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information and Services Center)\nSean McCartney, NASA DEVELOP\nKatherine Blanchette, NASA TOPS\nAlycia Crall, Carpentries\nElizabeth Joyner, NASA Science Directorate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{openscapes2023,\n  author = {Openscapes and Openscapes and The Carpentries},\n  title = {A {Carpentries} {Community} {Session} with {NASA} and\n    {Openscapes}},\n  date = {2023-10-05},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOpenscapes, and Openscapes and The Carpentries. 2023. “A\nCarpentries Community Session with NASA and Openscapes.” October\n5, 2023."

    "text": "Julie Lowndes and Ileana Fenwick are giving the plenary talk at the 2023 U.S. EPA R User Group Workshop. Julie and Ileana will share stories from Openscapes Champions Cohorts in government and academia and from initiatives like Pathways to Open Science for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science.\nThe virtual workshop has a great lineup of lightning talks and hands-on workshops. Open to U.S. EPA staff only.\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD, Director of Openscapes is a marine ecologist working at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science. Julia’s main focus is mentoring teams to develop technical and leadership mindsets and skills for data-intensive research, grounded in climate solutions, inclusion, and kindness. She founded Openscapes in 2018 as a Mozilla Fellow and Senior Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), having earned her PhD from Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate.\nIleana Fenwick is a core Openscapes team member; she is an open science advocate and Marine Sciences Ph.D. Student at UNC Chapel Hill. Ileana’s research focuses on evaluating how marine communities respond to climate change and human impacts. Her work uses innovative quantitative methods to improve our ocean management outcomes. In addition to her research, Ileana is also a fierce advocate for HBCU engagement and equity in open science and marine science through her consulting and volunteer work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{openscapes2023,\n  author = {Openscapes and Openscapes},\n  title = {Openscapes Plenary at {US} {EPA} {R} {User} {Group} Workshop},\n  date = {2023-10-17},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOpenscapes, and Openscapes. 2023. “Openscapes Plenary at US EPA R\nUser Group Workshop.” October 17, 2023."
