    "text": "We believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science.\n\n\nThese are critical to uncovering enduring science-based solutions faster, as well as for the well-being and resilience of research communities. We work towards kinder science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. There are many ways to practice open science and to welcome others to participate. We see data analysis and stewardship as powerful entryways for open science, and we meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skillsets and mindsets of immediate value while empowering them as leaders. We are influenced and inspired by many leaders and community organizers, particularly in climate justice and get out the vote movements.\nWe know that daily demands leave little time for researchers to transition to better data practices and open science, which can be lonely and overwhelming. Openscapes helps researchers reimagine data-intensive science, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research teams. We do this through mentorship, coaching, teaching, and community organizing, leveraging existing resources from the open community along with our own. Our activities include:\n\nOpenscapes Champions Program: A remote-by-design, cohort-based open data science mentorship program for research groups. Cohorts of research groups are mentored with their peers over several months following the Champions Lesson Series, and learn how to supercharge their research.\nOpenscapes Framework: A scalable leadership and community building framework that supports researchers and staff transitioning to open data science. The framework involves developing a Mentor community, empowering science teams through the Champions Program, and scaling the Champions program with the Mentors in a way that is sustainable and supported. See our flywheel below, and an example: NASA Openscapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes Flywheel (Robinson & Lowndes 2022; preprint). The Flywheel concept was developed by Jim Collins in the book Good to Great. No matter how dramatic the end result, good-to-great transformations never happen in one fell swoop. Rather, the process resembles relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond.\n\n\nWe share our most current thinking and showcase community efforts through talks and publications on our media page. Some recent highlights include:\n\nBetter Science for Future Us — Lowndes & Robinson 2021, invited plenary at the inaugural Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (SORTEE) conference\nHow to empower researchers with open science through meeting analytical needs and supporting people — Lowndes 2020, invited talk at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Roundtable\nEntryways to open data science and the power of welcome — Lowndes 2020, invited plenary at the Earth Science Information Partners Conference\nPutting data to work — Robinson 2020, invited Leptoukh Lecture at the American Geophysical Union Conference\nOpen software means kinder science — Lowndes 2019, Scientific American\n\nWe’re also developing the Openscapes Approach Guide  openly as an attempt to codify our approach so that we can onboard others to the team. Aligned with our values for kinder, open science, we are developing it openly and designing it so that others can also use the Openscapes Approach on their own too.\n\nOur theory of change is that by engaging, empowering, and amplifying researchers with open habits and mindsets for data-intensive science, they become leaders in the open science movement and have more enduring scientific impact while also creating a kinder, more inclusive scientific culture.\nWe are iterating our theory of change as we learn, and have also summarized it with this illustration:\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes Theory of Change: As teams tackle research questions (blue), their approaches (grey) can be accelerated through open data science practices (green), which are underpinned by existing open source tools (orange). Art by Allison Horst.\n\nIn mentoring research teams, we are interested in evaluating and understanding which open data science tools are adopted, who participates, and how questions and mindsets shift. Our hypothesis is that adoption of open data science tools will lead to robust, data-driven outcomes; that participation in open data science practices will lead to deeper inclusion and belonging; and that shifting mindsets and questions asked will lead to enduring partnerships and expanded questions. We define open data science as the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive data-driven research.\n\nA Theory of Change (TOC) is a way to think through and communicate the goals of a project to help track progress when it’s not possible to use more traditional metrics (i.e. revenue). The purpose is to articulate the overall aim/long-term impact, and the outcomes expected through the activities you do. Outcomes must be measurable (through appropriate indicators) so you can use the TOC to track progress.\nOur Theory of Change is stylized after Mozilla’s AI TOC. This is a useful resource for creating your own from project-oracle (recommended by Mozilla)."

    "text": "Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.\n\n\n\nWe support researchers to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. We work with academic, government, and non-profit research teams who become part of the open science movement as Champions empowered with new skill-sets and mindsets for modern data-intensive science. Learn these Champions’ stories through our blog, media, as well as steps for you to supercharge your research.\n\n“Openscapes isn’t just about coding and GitHub, it’s about changing how we do science” — Dr. Malin Pinsky, Rutgers University\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the the open data science landscape, there are many paths forward. Through the Champions program we help researchers move from lonely research to team science with community through exploring and navigating pathways together. Artwork by Allison Horst.\n\n\n\n\nPROGRAM DETAILS\n\nFor Openscapes at a glace, check out our overview slides.\nOpenscapes Champions is a multi-month program that is led remotely and designed to ignite incremental and sustainable change within research groups — and beyond. The program remotely convenes a cohort of science teams twice per month over two or four months for 1.5-hour video calls that we call Cohort Calls. This is not a workshop. The Champions program design is modeled after Mozilla Open Leaders, where small time requirements over longer time frames and participants focused on their existing work fosters incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientists’ busy schedules, varying expertise and needs.\nEach Cohort Call uses the Champions Lesson Series, which is an open curriculum originally based on what was instrumental in the Ocean Health Index (OHI) team’s path to better science in less time, and openly iterated as we experiment and learn. We start off each call with a reminder of our Code of Conduct and provide multiple channels for participation, including through silent contributions to the Google Doc Agenda, breakout groups, and full-group discussions. Each call closes with an efficiency tip and an inclusion tip to incorporate into daily practice.\nParticipants attend as teams, and come prepared for engaged participation as a whole cohort and within smaller breakout groups (as teams and mixed across teams). Discussions focus around collaborative mindsets, norms, and software to enable open, reproducible, inclusive research, introducing tools like R, tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, Google Drive, and Twitter and practices from open source communities, inclusive design, psychological safely, facilitation techniques, and examples from specific research domains including the OHI and previous Champions. Teams intentionally have a mix of data/coding experience and responsibilities; there are no coding prerequisites to participate.\nOpenscapes Champions program is designed so that everyone can learn new approaches and make progress, no matter where they are starting from. Each team creates a Pathway document to start thinking about where they are now in terms of the tools and practices for reproducibility, collaboration, communication, and culture. Throughout the Cohort, teams develop their Pathway to help identify, prioritize and articulate their needs and next steps. Pathway progress from each team is presented in the final session, which helps participants practice articulating their data workflow plans and needs, and see similarities and allies across the cohort to continue on these paths together.\nWith Cohort Calls occurring twice monthly on alternating weeks, the time in between each session enables participants to reflect and practice new concepts of immediate value to their own work while the Openscapes team incorporates feedback and iterates to better support cohort needs. One way we suggest reinforcing this reflection and practice is through a regular practice of separate team data-workflow meetings (we call “Seaside Chats”) in the alternating weeks between cohort calls. This gives them an opportunity to share their learning with their broader team or collaborators, to work on their Pathways with their teams and identify, discuss norms around data and code management and inclusive onboarding practices, and identify things they want to learn together and things they can teach each other.\nThe remote- and cohort-nature of the program is designed to reinforce each other’s learnings and networks across participating teams, with the purpose of empowering folks with open data science, and strengthening mindsets and habits to make data workflows and team culture more efficient and resilient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAMPIONS COHORTS\n\nExplore previous Openscapes Champions Cohorts to learn about these inspiring teams’ research and open data science momentum.\n\n“This program has honestly completely re-made how I think about my science. Openscapes is a supportive training course for moving your lab toward open science, that meets you where you are.” — Dr. Chelsea Wood, University of Washington\n\n\n“Openscapes has created a new way of thinking about merging empathy and science. That’s an invaluable gift to me.” — Dr. Halley Froehlich, University of California Santa\n\n\n“My group needs to collaborate better and [Openscapes] provided good exposure to tools and mindsets that facilitate open science.” - Lead at NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAMPIONS LESSON SERIES\n\nThe Openscapes Champions Program is strongly motivated by open data science, and with that comes the mindset of openness, collaboration, inclusion, trust, and creating the culture we want in science.\nThe Openscapes Champions Lessons Series is the core curriculum that we use in the Champions Program. It is iterated openly, with the most recent version always available online. Each Chapter has associated slides used in Cohort Calls, which we cover in Cohort Calls.\nThe Lesson Series is originally framed around the the tools and practices critical to the OHI team’s path to better science in less time, with examples from the open source programming language R and R communities. However, the concepts are relevant no matter the programming language, and we continually invest in this curriculum to incorporate examples from other languages and communities as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRESOURCES\n\nOur Resources page has some resources meant to welcome environmental scientists who are newly onboarding to open data science. We also have a public Openscapes Zotero library linking publications, talks, and curricula. Our Openscapes GitHub Organization has pinned repositories of interest, including the teaching-learning-resources repo where we use Issues to jot down specific tools or learning resources for open, reproducible, inclusive science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\nLearn more about how research groups participate in our Frequently Asked Questions."

    "text": "Openscapes is an approach for doing better science for future us.\n\n\nWe offer mentorship, teaching, coaching and community organizing centered around open data science: we help teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes story starts with file names like “data_analysis_final_v2b.xls” — you know the ones. It is a story about reimagining what’s possible when we modernize how we collaborate as part of the open movement.\nOpenscapes has been co-developed by Julia Lowndes and Erin Robinson, combining their expertise of open data science and open data stewardship, community and program building, teaching and coaching, as well as their lived experience as researchers. Together, they built the Openscapes as a value-based initiative that builds momentum like a flywheel and sustainably supports research teams with open science. With the Openscapes Champions flagship program and the first cohort of research teams, Openscapes was initially launched by Julia through a Mozilla Fellowship in 2018.\nErin joined in 2020 and together they created the Openscapes Framework that supports scaling Openscapes into a movement with the Openscapes mentor community. Openscapes mentors are people embedded in science organizations that learn to lead Openscapes Champions programs for their organization. This framework was developed through a NASA grant that Julia and Erin lead. Beyond NASA, the Framework has supported mentors at several other organizations like NOAA, and the California Water Boards.\nWe are excited to continue learning and iterating with the open movement towards kinder, better science for future us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn about our our team who are helping grow and improve Openscapes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a welcoming, safe, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nWe expect all participants to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which was influenced and adapted from rOpenSci and Mozilla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllison Horst creates original art for Openscapes, beginning as an artist in residence at NCEAS. Formerly an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California at Santa Barbara, currently a Data Scientist Advocate at Observable, Allison is also one of the inaugural Openscapes Champions. With a background in the fine arts, she also works digitally – explore her stats illustrations and follow her on Twitter.\nSee all of Allison’s open landscapes on the gallery page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur logo designed by Allison Horst represents both the open landscapes and the data within them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thank our funders for supporting open science tools, people, and communities. Openscapes was originally created with support from Mozilla, which also sponsored the first Champions Cohort.
