    "text": "We believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science.\n\n\nThese are critical to uncovering enduring science-based solutions faster, as well as for the well-being and resilience of research communities. We work towards kinder science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. There are many ways to practice open science and to welcome others to participate. We see data analysis and stewardship as powerful entryways for open science, and we meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skillsets and mindsets of immediate value while empowering them as leaders. We are influenced and inspired by many leaders and community organizers, particularly in climate justice and get out the vote movements.\nWe know that daily demands leave little time for researchers to transition to better data practices and open science, which can be lonely and overwhelming. Openscapes helps researchers reimagine data-intensive science, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research teams. We do this through mentorship, coaching, teaching, and community organizing, leveraging existing resources from the open community along with our own. Our activities include:\n\nOpenscapes Champions Program: A remote-by-design, cohort-based open data science mentorship program for research groups. Cohorts of research groups are mentored with their peers over several months following the Champions Lesson Series, and learn how to supercharge their research.\nOpenscapes Framework: A scalable leadership and community building framework that supports researchers and staff transitioning to open data science. The framework involves developing a Mentor community, empowering science teams through the Champions Program, and scaling the Champions program with the Mentors in a way that is sustainable and supported. See our flywheel below, and an example: NASA Openscapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes Flywheel (Robinson & Lowndes 2022; preprint). The Flywheel concept was developed by Jim Collins in the book Good to Great. No matter how dramatic the end result, good-to-great transformations never happen in one fell swoop. Rather, the process resembles relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond.\n\n\nWe share our most current thinking and showcase community efforts through talks and publications on our media page. Some recent highlights include:\n\nBetter Science for Future Us — Lowndes & Robinson 2021, invited plenary at the inaugural Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (SORTEE) conference\nHow to empower researchers with open science through meeting analytical needs and supporting people — Lowndes 2020, invited talk at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Roundtable\nEntryways to open data science and the power of welcome — Lowndes 2020, invited plenary at the Earth Science Information Partners Conference\nPutting data to work — Robinson 2020, invited Leptoukh Lecture at the American Geophysical Union Conference\nOpen software means kinder science — Lowndes 2019, Scientific American\n\n\n\n Check out our open educational resources!\n\n\nCreating the Openscapes Approach Guide is an attempt to codify our approach so that we can onboard others to the team. Aligned with our values for kinder, open science, we are developing it openly and designing it so that others can also use the Openscapes Approach on their own too.\n\n\n\n\nOur theory of change is that by engaging, empowering, and amplifying researchers with open habits and mindsets for data-intensive science, they become leaders in the open science movement and have more enduring scientific impact while also creating a kinder, more inclusive scientific culture.\nWe are iterating our theory of change as we learn, and have also summarized it with this illustration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes Theory of Change: As teams tackle research questions (blue), their approaches (grey) can be accelerated through open data science practices (green), which are underpinned by existing open source tools (orange). Art by Allison Horst.\n\nIn mentoring research teams, we are interested in evaluating and understanding which open data science tools are adopted, who participates, and how questions and mindsets shift. Our hypothesis is that adoption of open data science tools will lead to robust, data-driven outcomes; that participation in open data science practices will lead to deeper inclusion and belonging; and that shifting mindsets and questions asked will lead to enduring partnerships and expanded questions. We define open data science as the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive data-driven research.\n\nA Theory of Change (TOC) is a way to think through and communicate the goals of a project to help track progress when it’s not possible to use more traditional metrics (i.e. revenue). The purpose is to articulate the overall aim/long-term impact, and the outcomes expected through the activities you do. Outcomes must be measurable (through appropriate indicators) so you can use the TOC to track progress.\nOur Theory of Change is stylized after Mozilla’s AI TOC. This is a useful resource for creating your own from project-oracle (recommended by Mozilla)."

    "text": "Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.\n\n\nWe support researchers to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. We work with academic, government, and non-profit research teams who become part of the open science movement as Champions empowered with new skill-sets and mindsets for modern data-intensive science. Learn these Champions’ stories through our blog, media, as well as steps for you to supercharge your research.\n\n“Openscapes isn’t just about coding and GitHub, it’s about changing how we do science” — Dr. Malin Pinsky, Rutgers University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the the open data science landscape, there are many paths forward. Through the Champions program we help researchers move from lonely research to team science with community through exploring and navigating pathways together. Artwork by Allison Horst.\n\n\n\n\nFor Openscapes at a glace, check out our overview slides.\nOpenscapes Champions is a multi-month program that is led remotely and designed to ignite incremental and sustainable change within research groups — and beyond. The program remotely convenes a cohort of science teams twice per month over two or four months for 1.5-hour video calls that we call Cohort Calls. This is not a workshop. The Champions program design is modeled after Mozilla Open Leaders, where small time requirements over longer time frames and participants focused on their existing work fosters incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientists’ busy schedules, varying expertise and needs.\nEach Cohort Call uses the Champions Lesson Series, which is an open curriculum originally based on what was instrumental in the Ocean Health Index (OHI) team’s path to better science in less time, and openly iterated as we experiment and learn. We start off each call with a reminder of our Code of Conduct and provide multiple channels for participation, including through silent contributions to the Google Doc Agenda, breakout groups, and full-group discussions. Each call closes with an efficiency tip and an inclusion tip to incorporate into daily practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Check out our open educational resources!\n\n\nExplore the Champions Lesson Series, which introduces the concepts, tooling, and examples that are discussed during Champions Program Cohort Calls.

Discussions focus around collaborative mindsets, norms, and software to enable open, reproducible, inclusive research, introducing tools like R, tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, Google Drive, and Twitter and practices from open source communities, inclusive design, psychological safely, facilitation techniques, and examples from specific research domains including the OHI and previous Champions. Teams intentionally have a mix of data/coding experience and responsibilities; there are no coding prerequisites to participate.\nOpenscapes Champions program is designed so that everyone can learn new approaches and make progress, no matter where they are starting from. Each team creates a Pathway document to start thinking about where they are now in terms of the tools and practices for reproducibility, collaboration, communication, and culture. Throughout the Cohort, teams develop their Pathway to help identify, prioritize and articulate their needs and next steps. Pathway progress from each team is presented in the final session, which helps participants practice articulating their data workflow plans and needs, and see similarities and allies across the cohort to continue on these paths together.\nWith Cohort Calls occurring twice monthly on alternating weeks, the time in between each session enables participants to reflect and practice new concepts of immediate value to their own work while the Openscapes team incorporates feedback and iterates to better support cohort needs. One way we suggest reinforcing this reflection and practice is through a regular practice of separate team data-workflow meetings (we call “Seaside Chats”) in the alternating weeks between cohort calls. This gives them an opportunity to share their learning with their broader team or collaborators, to work on their Pathways with their teams and identify, discuss norms around data and code management and inclusive onboarding practices, and identify things they want to learn together and things they can teach each other.\nThe remote- and cohort-nature of the program is designed to reinforce each other’s learnings and networks across participating teams, with the purpose of empowering folks with open data science, and strengthening mindsets and habits to make data workflows and team culture more efficient and resilient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore previous Openscapes Champions Cohorts to learn about these inspiring teams’ research and open data science momentum.\n\n“This program has honestly completely re-made how I think about my science.

Regardless of research question, environmental scientists are united by the need to analyze data — and to do so in a way that is efficient, reproducible, and easily communicated. With tools specifically created to meet modern demands for collaborative data science, we help create a positive open culture to enable better science in less time. Our approach:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENGAGE\n\n\nWe build awareness and excitement. We engage scientists with the possibilities of open data science with empathy, art, and storytelling, using narratives like our own path to better science in less time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMPOWER\n\n\nWe help build confidence and skills. We empower scientists by connecting them with existing open software and communities that meet them where they are so they can develop the skills they need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMPLIFY\n\n\nWe build champions and communities.

    "text": "Version 2.1, June 2022\n\n\n\nSupporting a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone in our community is paramount, as is strengthening connections with other communities that have influenced our work. Our Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area.\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nDiversity is our strength, we try to cultivate a tone where everyone in the community, no matter their backgrounds and accomplishments, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. In this mindset, questions are always welcome and appropriate because they don’t expose the lack of knowledge of the asker. Rather, questions expose opportunities for clarification for the original communicator, and for further opening up the conversation to include different perspectives and learning styles.\nIn our community we encourage listening and empathy in all of our interactions. This means:\nBe Respectful\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\nBe Direct but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\nNot native language speakers\nComing from a different culture, perspective, or background\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\nLiving in a different time zone\nFacing other challenges to participate\n\nIf you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back, encourage other voices to join in, and listen actively to them.\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ perspectives, contributions, and needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for our community.\n\n\n\nBe respectful, honest, inclusive, accommodating, appreciative, and open to learning from everyone else.\nDo not attack, demean, disrupt, harass, or threaten others or encourage such behavior.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the Openscapes community, including Openscapes staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, remote calls, and in person at Openscapes -hosted events.\n\n\n\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the organiser Julia Lowndes at openscapes @ nceas.ucsb.edu or independent community member Allison Horst at ahorst @ ucsb.edu with a description of what has occurred and any supporting information that would be helpful. After receiving a concise description of your situation, Julia or Allison will review the report and determine next steps. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nThe Openscapes Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area (see Mozilla’s inclusion repo. Additional resources influencing this document include Postit (formerly RStudio), Open Post Academics, and the groups described in open software means kinder science.

    "text": "The Openscapes Champions Program is not a typical training workshop for individuals. Through Openscapes you focus on your own work with your team.\n\n\nAs Openscapes introduces modern concepts, tooling, and examples from your peers for collaborative open data science, your team focuses on where you are and where you want to go together.\nOne of the biggest benefits we hear from past Champions is that Openscapes helps them “find their team” by identifying common needs and solutions, which makes science feel less lonely. While teams do not require a shared project, teams should not be arbitrarily constructed. Teams should be colleagues who already interact around research and will continue to, for example a research lab or group.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of flexibility in choosing your team for the Openscapes Champions program. We designed it with academic research groups in mind, to provide resilience where there is high turnover and folks might be struggling with similar challenges around data analysis while working on different projects. But we’re increasingly working with research groups of different kinds and needs! We expect a range of technical ability and training experience; most importantly is selecting folks that have interest in making daily practices more efficient and developing collaboration and leadership skills.\nTeams do not need to have a specific shared research project to participate. The idea is that by developing shared open data science habits within the research group, it will be easier to onboard new folks and offboard knowledge/data/code/etc when folks leave. And, as more and more research groups work this way, it can ease transitions between research groups (i.e. when students graduate and take a position with a different research group).\nThe Champions Program is structured for teams with the intent that research group leads (faculty, lecturers, program managers, etc) and members (students, post-docs, analysts, lab managers, etc.) participate as a team together. This is a strategy so that the lead does not necessarily have to be an expert/comfortable with open data science to enable their team to design open data science workflows. Group leads and members participate together so that:\n\neveryone sees and values what is possible with open data science\nleads enable members to invest time in learning skills and developing shared workflows as part of their jobs\nmembers have guidance, agency, and support to incorporate open data science concepts into their work\neveryone champions open data science and contributes to growing the community of practice within the research group, institution, and beyond, in whatever capacity their roles and circumstances (time limitations & responsibilities) allow.\n\nChoosing your team can be based on interests around data analysis and around leadership. There are no prerequisite skills to participate, just an interest to learn and contribute. The “homework” between Champions sessions and beyond is to meet with your full research group (beyond workshop participants, and optional for the lead) to establish shared workflows and habits within the research group.\n\nHow you define \"team\" is completely up to you and having one person be in the cohort and using in-between session \"seaside chats\" to bring back the information to another group is 100% fine. That is common in the cohorts. In my first Openscapes cohort, I was the only person from my project. My personal goal was to use the Openscapes structure to help a team that I am on figure out how to tackle some off-boarding tasks due to a retirement. During my second cohort, there were 2 team members in the cohort and 2 not in the cohort. We focused on standardizing our data to get ready for our GitHub served data package. For the 3rd cohort I am doing, 2⁄3 of our team is in the cohort as we start to get organized for a major revamp of our report into a reproducible workflow. - Eli Holmes (NOAA NWFSC, NMFS-Openscapes)\n\n\n\n\nNo, the idea is to help individuals within a research group see themselves as part of a team. With this team mindset, your most important collaborator is Future You. Working with Future You in mind helps you spend more time on answering awesome research questions rather than trying to make sense of data_analysis_finalv2b.xls. And a team mindset also includes Future Us in the research group, so that onboarding and offboarding is more efficient and so that participation in science can be more inclusive and equitable.\n\n\n\nYes; we do try to have everyone on the team attend all Cohort Calls – but know that sometimes that’s not possible. The Cohort Calls are synchronous: in 90 mins, we teach for ~30 and the rest of the time is you discussing and applying open data science ideas to your own work with your team, and learning from your fellow champions. All the lessons, slides, and also recordings are available if people have to miss, but everyone should sign up expecting to be at the Cohort Calls.\n\n\n\nIt’s important that team leads attend with their team. The Champions program is designed to reduce the burden for PIs in the long term and develop leadership within and across their teams. With this investment now, team leads and members will build resilient and enduring practices for their research group, even as that research group changes into the future. The idea is that together, the whole team sees what’s possible with open data science and builds confidence, ownership, and a shared pathway forward. Then it’s the entire team, not just the PI, who puts it to practice in between sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, the cohort does not need a shared project; each team will work on what they need to for their own research. Teams within a cohort do not need to be closely related, but having teams somewhat related is good for community building (i.e. environmental science or psychology).\n\n\n\nFrom our experiences so far think that ~8 teams with 4-5 participants per team (maximum of ~40 participants) is a good size so there is time for everyone to be engaged and contributing (and not feeling like a passive webinar). Also, having a good amount of members per team is really key to the whole model of Openscapes: we want to reduce the amount of burden for PIs to have to relay info to their research groups. Having more members participate as a team in the Openscapes program helps more team members feel agency to build resilient systems with less transmission time."

    "text": "Every Friday during the academic year, the University of Toronto Missisauga Department of Biology hosts an exciting seminar given by a guest speaker. Topics cover every aspect of biology, from whole organisms to molecular biology. Julie and Ileana were selected and invited by grad students.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: At Openscapes, we believe open science can accelerate interoperable, data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in research and beyond. Our main activity is mentoring environmental and Earth science teams in open science, and connecting and elevating them both through tech like R, Python, Quarto, and JupyterHubs and communities like RLadies, Black Women in Ecology Evolution, and Marine Science, Ladies of Landsat, and NASA. We’ll share stories and approaches about supporting open science as a daily practice – better science for future us – and welcome you to join the movement.\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD, Director of Openscapes is a marine ecologist working at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science. Julia’s main focus is mentoring teams to develop technical and leadership mindsets and skills for data-intensive research, grounded in climate solutions, inclusion, and kindness. She founded Openscapes in 2018 as a Mozilla Fellow and Senior Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), having earned her PhD from Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate.\nIleana Fenwick is a core Openscapes team member; she is an open science advocate and Marine Sciences Ph.D. Student at UNC Chapel Hill. Ileana’s research focuses on evaluating how marine communities respond to climate change and human impacts. Her work uses innovative quantitative methods to improve our ocean management outcomes. In addition to her research, Ileana is also a fierce advocate for HBCU engagement and equity in open science and marine science through her consulting and volunteer work.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{2023,\n  author = {, Openscapes and , Openscapes},\n  title = {Openscapes: Supporting Kinder Science for Future Us},\n  date = {2023-03-31},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOpenscapes, and Openscapes. 2023. “Openscapes: Supporting Kinder\nScience for Future Us.” March 31, 2023."

In the Northeast, data flow from individual businesses and/or scientific samplers to the region’s scientific and management organizations. This web of information can be difficult to access as much of the content is confidential in its raw form. Further, many of the codes and systems used to store these data are poorly documented, and even routine analyses are not commonly shared among data users. Currently, FDD are therefore difficult to integrate into scientific advice for ecosystem based fisheries management. Analysts tend to be unfamiliar with the data or hesitant to explore their potential, and data can be viewed with skepticism rather than leveraged in new and innovative ways. There is a need to begin to provide access, documentation, and cultivate a community of practice that focuses on using these data to their full potential.\nThis opportunity is funded through NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and a grant from the Fisheries Information System Program through an award to UMass Dartmouth-SMAST through CINAR.

The NASA Openscapes Framework (https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) is supporting scientific researchers using NASA Earthdata from Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. Through the Openscapes approach, which builds on collaborative open design and software from open source communities, including Mozilla, RStudio, The Carpentries, and Pangeo, we are currently working with a cross-DAAC mentor community to co-create learning resources and strengthen empathy-centered teaching practices to empower research teams through this migration to the cloud. We are focusing on building community across teams through identifying common goals and developing shared processes while also developing technical skills for contributing, review, and teaching.

Registration open\n\nJoin us for a conversation and demo’s with Sean Kross, Data Staff Scientist at the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab and developer of the kyber R package. At Openscapes, we use kyber to automate several key workflows for creating and populating GitHub repos with READMEs and creating detailed lesson agendas from RMarkdown content that is referenced in Google Sheets. This saves us time and reduces errors that can be introduced by repetitive copy-pasting. Come learn some of the nuts and bolts of how kyber works, imagine what’s possible for your own workflows, and get Sean’s expert advice about engaging in this kind of tool-development project.\nBring your own questions. We always save time for audience discussion!\n\nGuest bio\nSean Kross is a Data Staff Scientist at the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab.

Our main activity is mentoring environmental and Earth science teams in open science, and connecting and elevating these researchers both through tech like R, Python, Quarto, and JupyterHubs and communities like RLadies, Black Women in Ecology Evolution, and Marine Science, Ladies of Landsat, and NASA. We will share stories and approaches about open science as a daily practice – better science for future us – and welcome you to join the movement.\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD, Director of Openscapes is a marine ecologist working at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science. Julia's main focus is mentoring teams to develop technical and leadership mindsets and skills for data-intensive research, grounded in climate solutions, inclusion, and kindness. She founded Openscapes in 2018 as a Mozilla Fellow and Senior Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), having earned her PhD from Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{2023,\n  author = {, Openscapes and , Openscapes},\n  title = {WiDS {Stanford} 2023},\n  date = {2023-03-08},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOpenscapes, and Openscapes. 2023. “WiDS Stanford 2023.”\nMarch 8, 2023."

We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. This opportunity is funded by Code for Science and Society (CS&S), whose event fund supports events that promote inclusion and broaden participation in open data science that drives scholarship.\nOpenscapes Champions is a remote-by-design, cohort-based mentorship program that guides teams through the open data science landscape, empowers them as leaders, and welcomes them as part of the growing open community. This two-month remote program will help you establish shared, reproducible practices for data analysis that help make your research group more efficient and inclusive. You will participate with others from your research group as a team, as a cohort with your peers. Together, you will learn how to reframe data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden, through exploring open data science tools and community practices (e.g. R/RStudio, GitHub). For more information and guidance about selecting your team, please visit openscapes.org/champions.\n\nCohort Details\nWe will meet four times over two months, on alternating Fridays in 2021.\n\nDates: May 7, May 21, June 4, June 18\nTimes: 9:30-11:00am PST\nWhere: remotely, via Zoom\nWho: Cohort of 7 environmental research teams. Each team consists of a team lead (faculty, lecturer, program manager, etc) and up to 4 team members of your choice (students, researchers, analysts, etc).\nCost: Free; this opportunity is sponsored by CS&S\nExpected time commitment: In addition to 3 hours/month over Zoom as a full Champions Cohort, participants will meet independently to further discuss topics with their research group. The total expected time commitment is 5hrs/month for 2 months.\n\n\n\nNominate your team to participate\nNominate your team by filling out this Google Form by March 26, 2021. Please submit one nomination per team, preferably by the team lead (faculty, project manager. principal investigator, etc).

Julie Lowndes and Allison Horst will be co-presenting a keynote talk on June 5. There is a great lineup of speakers and we are excited to be a part of it!\nSlides available at openscapes.org/media.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Open science as a movement and the art of Openscapes\nAbstract: The open science movement is “a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding” (Ramachandran et al 2021). We’ve felt included in this movement through the #rstats community, and argue that data science is a powerful entryway to welcome researchers to open science – one that transforms open science from an aspirational idea to a tangible daily benefit for efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration. We will share how Openscapes is helping to onboard more research teams to the open science movement, in part through artwork to represent and develop ideas to make open science more inclusive and kind.\nJulia Stewart Lowndes @juliesquid is a marine data scientist and Senior Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). As founding director of Openscapes (created during her Mozilla Fellowship) she champions kinder, better science in less time and empowers science teams with skillsets and mindsets for open, reproducible research. She earned her PhD at Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate. She is a Carpentries instructor and co-founder of Eco-Data-Science and R-Ladies Santa Barbara.\nAllison Horst @allison_horst is an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where she has been teaching environmental data science, math and data analysis courses since 2012. Through her artwork, Allison illustrates data science concepts, R packages and functions, workflows and mindsets to welcome and support R learners, and was RStudio’s Artist-in-Residence from 2019 - 2020. She co-founded and is an active member of the UCSB TidyTuesday coding club and R-Ladies Santa Barbara. She has also created all artwork for Openscapes and was a mentee in the inaugural Champions Cohort!\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{2021,\n  author = {, Openscapes and , CascadiaR},\n  title = {CascadiaR {Conference}},\n  date = {2021-06-05},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOpenscapes, and CascadiaR. 2021. “CascadiaR Conference.”\nJune 5, 2021."

    "text": "In Fall 2022, Openscapes ran four concurrent Champions Cohorts that included participants from all NOAA Fisheries Science Centers, described in Nationwide Openscapes Training At NOAA Fisheries Science Centers: Facilitating Collaboration, Skill-Sharing, and Open Science. This post is the executive summary shared with Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) leadership of the work and experiences of AFSC research staff participants.\nUpdate February 21, 2023\nAFSC supported 8 teams from across the center in the 2022 Fall Openscapes Cohort of the Openscapes Champions training program. The teams focussed their energy on a range of important research issues supporting the AFSC mission including fishing tagging, fisheries surveys, marine mammals, genetics, shellfish, fish life history, and survey preparation. The teams consisted of 39 AFSC researchers from 7 AFSC divisions. Three of the 8 teams were cross-divisional. All teams developed their skills for improved analysis workflows, report writing, and manuscript preparation; promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration; improving on- and off-boarding processes; and integrated project management. This was achieved in the context of expanding open data science efforts within NOAA and the greater scientific community.\nFor each team, the training was just the beginning of a longer process. Over the four-week course of the workshop, the teams felt that Openscapes provided them with the support and time to tackle previously intangible tasks, track their progress, and install long-term collaboration and project management practices. While each team tackled very different challenges and goals with unique approaches, they often came to realize that their work needs had universal themes. Teams found new ways to fulfill needs for increased transparency, inclusivity, streamlining workflows, and professional development. The support and enthusiasm of AFSC leadership for AFSC to develop new skills and best practices is critical to AFSC’s continued organizational excellence. Participants in the training also recognized the need for additional training in specific skills and technologies (e.g., R, Python, Jupyter notebooks, Julia, Git and GitHub, Quarto, Posit Connect, reproducible analysis, and collaborative writing). The AFSC can support these needs by 1) identifying and funding training opportunities, and 2) encouraging scientists and supervisors to allocate work time to expanding knowledge and exploring new open data science skills.\nAs in the first AFSC Openscapes cohort, participants from this cohort found the training transformative. The training created a supportive forum for continued learning and collaboration across programs and divisions. As mentors, we are committed to maintaining the community of support and active learning that was established during the training. We feel confident that AFSC’s continued investment in Openscapes will establish AFSC scientists as leaders in open data science, enhance collaborations across divisions and centers, ensure continuity of long-term research efforts, and improve scientific communication with stakeholders."

    "section": "The Teams and Their Achievements",
    "text": "The Teams and Their Achievements\nThe 2022 Fall Openscapes cohort training took place over 5 remote calls from October 5 to November 30, 2022. Cohort calls focused on 1) establishing open science mindset and introducing psychological safety (call 1 digest), 2) publishing and project management on GitHub (call 2 digest), 3) instituting team culture and data strategies (call 3 digest), 4) nurturing open science communities and coding strategies (call 4 digest), and 5) developing each team’s path forward as they continue their open science journeys after Openscapes training (call 5 digest). Participants’ GitHub usernames are provided within each team description to connect them to their Openscapes work.\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of some of AFSC’s Openscapes participants over Zoom\n\n\n\nThe Marine Mammal Lab/RSST Lab Manual team focused their efforts on developing lab manuals for their teams. This team includes Katie Luxa (@katie-luxa), Erin Moreland (@eem1), Kim Shelden (@kewshel), Nancy Friday (@NAFriday), Cynthia Christman (@ChristmanCL), and Joanna Magner (@joannamagner-noaa; RSST). This cross-division collaboration gave the participants a wider-ranging perspective and an understanding of the universal problems different teams experience. Their lab manual covers on-/off-boarding, outreach, lab safety, field safety, travel, time and attendance, and employee resources. This lab manual was developed by referencing other lab manuals (e.g., Fay lab manual and with the team’s new skills in Quarto, GitHub repo and project management, and GitHub issue tracking. The lab manuals team saw this effort as an opportunity to unbury important lab and employee info from emails in one accessible page. Once complete, this MML lab manual will be moved to the AFSC Marine Mammal Lab GitHub Organization. The members of this team felt that their achievements and end products were more robust and inclusive because of how diversified their team was. The members of this team work across different programs and specialize in research on different species, and could share nuanced perspectives of what different documents and resources should include.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the AFSC Marine Mammal Lab Manual.\n\n\n\nThe AFSC Genetics team is motivated to develop a streamlined analysis pipeline. This team is represented by Patrick Barry (@PatrickBarry-NOAA), Diana Baetscher (@DianaBaetscher-NOAA), Sara Schaal (@SaraSchaal), and Claire Tobin (@ClaireTobin-NOAA). The team created a new GitHub organization that allows them to oversee product development, assign issues, and direct overall project management in teams that include postdocs and collaborators. GitHub provides tools for code versioning, documentation, and product testing that were critical for developing this pipeline. Together, they created different GitHub repositories for different projects and initiatives (e.g., sample collection, lab work, data storage) with links to resources and google docs. Members of the team came from a wide range of open science experience levels and worked together to teach and learn from each other through this process.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the AFSC Genetics GitHub Organization.\n\n\n\nThe PCod Tagging and MARVLS team set out on the dynamic task of streamlining multiple data sources to product workflow and diversified data management. This team is comprised of Susanne McDermott (@smcdermo), Julie Nielsen (@jknielsen), Kimberly Rand (@kimberlyrand), Liz Dawson (@liz-dawson-NOAA), Bianca Prohaska (@bianca-prohaska-NOAA), Christina Conrath (@ConrathCl), and Ajith Abraham (@Abraham-7600; OFIS) and ranged across several Pacific cod tagging sub-projects across RACE, the Maturity Assessment, Reproductive Variability, Life Strategy (MARVLS) group, and OFIS. Data from the tagged fish are opportunistically collected when a tag pops off a fish and reaches the sea surface and satellite connection and need to be regularly integrated into reports, websites, and on data sharing platforms. The team used mural boards to assist planning their database workflow and design. This visualization also helped motivate the team, outline what the next steps were, and create and assign tasks. When the team participants came together to work on this project, they were confronted with how similar their project themes and needs were.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a section of the PCod Tagging Team’s database proposed design and workflow in Mural.\n\n\n\nThe MML Field Report team focused on new methods for working together and developing a ready-for-publication field report. This team includes Kim Goetz (@kimtgoetz), Megan Ferguson (@megancatonferguson), Molly McCormley (@mmccorml), Burlyn Birkmeier (@burlynb), and Amelia Brower (@ameliabrower-noaa). For this project, the team leaned on Eli Holmes’s book chapter code and quarto discussion forums, especially since Quarto is new and quickly evolving. This allowed the team to delegate chapter assignments and other report tasks (e.g., create a new section, edit yaml file, build report) through GitHub issues for team members to work on. The iterative and collaborative nature of the GitHub platform allowed the team to work through the idiosyncrasies of book and page formatting.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a section of the MML field report team’s draft field report pdf made in Quarto.\n\n\n\nThe Oyster Monitoring and MML team comprises Peter Mahoney (@pmahoney-noaa), Skyla Walcott (@skylawalcott), Alex Zerbini (@alex-zerbini), Gavin Brady (@GavinMBrady), and Jordan Hollarsmith (@jhollarsmithnoaa). The team is formed of a composite of people from across the center who assisted their peers on their Oyster Monitoring project. For this effort, the team discussed how their universal work needs can be improved by universal lessons and learning GitHub project boards, Quarto, Mural boards (inspired by the PCod tagging team) and RMarkdown. In the Oyster Monitoring GitHub repository, the team worked together to develop the repository and documentation, and they worked with a SeaGrant Fellow to make an interactive quarto report website for the project!\nThe Groundfish Assessment Program Data Workflow team is working to codify the methods used to calculate survey design-based indices. This is a partnership of the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska/Aleutian Islands groups, including Duane Stevenson (@Duane-Stevenson-NOAA), Lukas DeFilippo (@Lukas-DeFilippo-NOAA), and Sarah Friedman (@SarahFriedman-NOAA), and Zack Oyafuso (@zoyafuso-NOAA). There are many bespoke scripts across the survey groups, for calculations of slightly different flavors of design-based indices, of which running each was often siloed to one person and underwent little to no code review. Expanding on the work already in the GAP Data Products GitHub organization, the team is developing an R package that will consolidate these analyses, interact directly with GAP Oracle databases, and include instructional documentation and vignettes. The package will undergo annual code review and validation, and promote greater collaboration and transparency with data users (e.g., stock assessors). The team relied on GitHub for version control, to post, task, and address issues. In addition, the team led an effort to include the other members of GAP, by initiating working groups to focus on data processes, computations, and future technologies. The team hopes this effort will bring the two survey groups closer together, make these analyses repeatable and transferable, and help develop a future vision for Future Us.\nThe MACE team was represented by Denise McKelvey (@mckelveyd), Katherine Wilson (@KatherineWilson-NOAA), and David McGowan (@McGowanDW). The program provided the space and guidance for this team to further increase their skills in, and awareness of, the platforms that MACE already uses for collaborative development, maintenance, and sharing of code and standardized reports. The tutorials offered by Eli Holmes (@eeholmes) and the examples of how others have adapted these lessons inspired the team members to envision new ways to collaborate as a team and leverage these tools. The course reinforced the team’s knowledge that Git can facilitate collaborations and increase efficiency by streamlining workflows, tracking issues, and supporting reproducibility. The team appreciated the coding tips that were shared and the cultural change movement that the course inspires: shifting away from work silos and moving towards collaborative and open approaches.\nThe REFM Spectroscopy Tools for Life History Measurements team comprised Esther Goldstein (@EstherDGoldstein-NOAA), Sandi Neidetcher (@SandiKay), Morgan Arrington (@MorganArrington-NOAA), Irina Benson (@ibens-git), and Beth Matta (@BethMatta-NOAA). This team is working to develop standardized scripts for processing and analyzing spectroscopy data that can be reviewed and shared easily among multiple individuals and centers. This effort is part of a NOAA-wide strategic initiative to develop spectroscopy as a tool for life history measurements (e.g., age, maturity, fish condition). The team realized the need to shift away from siloed scripts used by individuals for specific projects to a generalized open-source format. The team discussed how their work can be improved by using GitHub repositories to review and share scripts, GitHub projects to track issues to assign tasks, and RMarkdown/ Quarto for generating reports more efficiently. The team worked together to develop a GitHub organization, their first repository, practice reviewing scripts, and address issues as a team."

Josh London and others presented the cohorts’ successes with Openscapes at the Earth Science Information Partners Conference (ESIP) on January 26, 2023. There is interest across AFSC in further Openscapes training and this may be enabled by a 3-year grant proposal (co-PI’s Julie Lowndes and Eli Holmes) that would further advance this movement toward more open science in NOAA Fisheries. We’re excited to see how things develop in 2023 alongside the White House’s Year of Open Science initiative."

These participants were from research teams, supervisors, and IT, and were interested in exploring new approaches to collaborating around complex workflows required in analyses and reports involving diverse teams, data flows, and analyses.\nThis Cohort was organized and coordinated by Adyan Rios, Molly Stevens, and Erica Rule, following Adyan’s participation in the 2021 Fall NMFS Cohort and her leadership since, including leading Surf Sessions, feature stories, and contributing to broader NMFS-Openscapes efforts including presenting to NMFS leadership. This post focuses on what the cohort setup and participants achieved.  See https://openscapes.org/champions for more background on the Champions program."

    "text": "What did the participants achieve?\nThis cohort was an opportunity for NOAA staff to explore and practice open data science approaches, but it was also an opportunity to meet and build relationships with folks across different parts of SEFSC, which has a wide geographic spread. Additionally, many folks have onboarded to NOAA during the ongoing pandemic and have not had the opportunity to meet many colleagues. It was exciting to see participants find alignment across NOAA missions, software, and supporting each other. Discussion topics were broad and also focused on the use of GitHub and Quarto for shared documentation. It was really inspiring to hear shared progress forward for more open and inclusive data science across the center. \nMany topics/themes that resonated with the 2022 SEFSC Summer Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. SEFSC has recently undergone a Center-Wide Realignment, and many staff have extremely limited time during this transition, resulting in cautious voluntary enlistment to additional tasks and training. With the 2022 Summer Cohort, there was a resounding sense of camaraderie and dedication to putting in the effort now to improve workflows for the future. Here are a few examples from our Pathways Presentations during our final session: \n\nUsing GitHub as outward-facing and internal communication\nSEFSC’s Sustainable Fisheries Division (SFD) coordinates and conducts stock assessments involving many external partners throughout the southeast region, including 8 states, 4 US territories, and 3 regional management bodies. This complexity requires both the streamlined dissemination of assessment details and a dedicated location for communicating final assessment decisions internally. Skyler Sagarese participated in the 2021 Fall NMFS Cohort and built a GitHub page to track assessment details for coordination between the lead analyst and data compiler. This format was expanded and improved upon during the 2022 Summer SEFSC Cohort to facilitate collaboration between 2 SEFSC divisions and 4 branches involved in stock assessments for internal communications and distribution of details to external data providers for 2 Operational SEDAR Assessments - see figure below. The more staff that are trained to use these tools, the more streamlined and efficient our workflows become, improving employee morale and increasing assessment throughput.\n\n\n\n\nExample screenshot from the Sustainable Fisheries Division Assessment Workflow Team showing how they use GitHub for both an outward facing page and internal issue / progress tracking 😍\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating and documenting a communication plan\nThe Biology and Life History Branch within Fisheries, Assessment, Technology, and Engineering Support Division (FATES-BLH) documented their communication plan which acknowledged the areas where they are successful and identified areas for improvement (see figures below). Their branch has weekly meetings to strategize and track progress in real time, but is working to improve documentation of resulting products for easy and reproducible assessment inputs throughout SEFSC. Their team has been collaborating with SFD to receive assessment details through GitHub pages as well as collaborating within version-controlled programs, removing task redundancy and resulting in streamlined workflows. They are also working to document institutional knowledge and species-specific data issues, where the distribution of these details will vastly improve analyses and data inputs for stock assessments in the southeast. With SEFSC realignment, branches are spread throughout multiple cities in the southeast region, necessitating efficient communication and workflows.\n\n\n\n\nFATES-BLH Branch team communication plan which highlights current successes and areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFATES-BLH Openscapes team in their new pathway!  SEFSC Staff are spread throughout multiple cities in the southeast region, but Openscapes has facilitated streamlined communication for all staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning improvements for reports\nReports and analyses for Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) are often recurring or require edits to data inputs throughout the process. These workflows are spread throughout individuals’ Google folders and collaborators have been communicating via multiple email threads.  The Openscapes Cohort helped this team to envision a better future with open science tools including data extraction code stored on GitHub that feeds directly into Quarto reports (see figure below). They also envision tracking current data versions with auto-generated date tags, an improvement over many versions of the same product in individual workflows that are difficult to track. The IEA team documented this process and improvements for the SEFSC 2022 Summer Cohort; many teams at SEFSC are working through similar issues and striving towards the highest quality data and most efficient generation of reports. All teams found common ground in this effort, highlighting positive impacts of open science practices that facilitate inspiration, expand collaboration, and synergize our diverse expertise across the Center.\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated Ecosystem Assessment team pathway towards improved data quality through version control, streamlined communications, and automated reports."

    "text": "Background: How NOAA Fisheries Openscapes Cohorts Worked\nFrom October-December 2022, over 150 staff from six NOAA Fisheries Science Centers and two Regional Offices, as well as from the Office of Science and Technology participated in the Openscapes Champions Program, a professional development training program for transforming analytical workflows with open science. Through four Champions Cohorts and joint activities, NOAA Fisheries staff focused on developing a mindset for “future us” (Lowndes et al. 2019). We worked on developing a growth mindset to learn new systems and software, and practiced talking openly with colleagues and screen-sharing to improve how we work. We also learned about integrating new tools into our workflows, alongside real examples from NOAA colleagues from a previous Alaska Fisheries Science Center Champions Cohort of how learning these practices and tools in previous trainings have streamlined how they work.\nThroughout the fall, we co-led these four Cohorts as NOAA Fisheries staff mentors, fostering a supportive work environment that embraced constant improvement and peer support. In addition to the bi-weekly facilitated cohort trainings where we learned from the Champions Lesson Series and discussed our experiences with colleagues, we supported free-form cohort coworking sessions to support our colleagues’ processes, and themed cross-cohort sessions with topics like Pathways, Quarto, GitHub project boards, and attributes of “Agile” open science team workflow concepts (NMFS Openscapes Fall Tutorials). In addition to the cohort sessions, we as mentors met as a peer-group across all four cohorts bi-weekly to debrief on the week’s sessions, refine planned activities based on revealed needs, and also skill-shared tech and facilitating tips. This peer mentor cohort is a core element of the goal of Openscapes to support, promote, and elevate local open science leaders in order to support sustainable organizational change. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Zoom screenshots of participants in four Fall 2022 NOAA Fisheries Cohorts"

    "text": "What we did and learned together in our Champions Cohorts\nStaff participated in Champions Cohorts as teams, reinforcing the idea that we’re not in this alone, and providing colleagues with whom we could not only practice concepts and tools but implement them in a real-life work setting to get our stuff done. For each of the teams, the Openscapes training was just the beginning of a longer process. Over the short few weeks of the workshop, the teams felt that Openscapes provided them with the support and space to tackle “wish-list” tasks (tasks they intended to do as a team for a long time but did not have dedicated time for), value their progress, and shift long-term practices within their workflows. While each team tackled very different challenges and goals (ranging from documentation, to report writing, to developing analyses) they recognized  universal themes during the training: transparency, inclusivity, continuity, project management, and professional development.\nThe early weeks were devoted to exploration of the concepts of data and analysis pathways. Through discussions, teams identified common needs (through narratives and diagrams) to understand how data and analysis outputs were processed, stored, and incorporated into their own work. The process of writing out and discussing the entire workflow also helped teams understand the way the silo-ing of work (e.g., I do my job and then pass it on) led to low team awareness of issues (problems) and difficulty for the team to help itself (peer collaboration).  Common themes were collaborative reports, moving toward databases, standardized formats and version-control of data, and away from Excel files emailed or in shared drive folders with ever-changing version numbers in multiple formats that each are ‘wrangled’ in different ways for each team member’s task. Teams were also eager to change to data and analysis processes that would allow reports to be written in Quarto or RMarkdown, and shared and versioned with GitHub. Thus creating transparent and more easily reproduced reports where the data, data wrangling, and analyses are all explicit (via code) within the report. This would also allow teams to migrate towards a report in multiple formats: pdf, Word and html, all generated from the same source.\nTeams were not only focused on “tools”. Equally important were discussions around team communication: within the team and external to the team, for example, data and information providers and the end-users (e.g., regional offices or the public). This showed up as shared standard operating protocols, onboarding and offboarding procedures, and documentation. This was a way to put to practice the concept of “future us” for teams with turnover (particularly in remote and hybrid situations) and sustainably tracking inventories. Changing the nature and tempo of team meetings was also a theme. Many teams expressed that “coworking” sessions were helpful and eye-opening—these were not update meetings but rather times that people came to work on a task together, screensharing to expose and solve problems, and learn workflows from each other (for example: using gmail filters to manage calendar invites or GitHub notifications in a folder to be reviewed rather than streaming into your inbox).\nThe fall Openscapes training was a powerful opportunity for teams, and individuals, to step back and do a deep reflection and review their report or data science workflows. Adopting an open and growth mindset, they then worked together as peers and teammates to develop concrete ways to move toward workflows that embrace the open science ethos."

    "section": "Specifics from each Cohort",
    "text": "Specifics from each Cohort\n\nAlaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)\nAFSC supported 8 teams from 7 divisions across the center; 3 included cross-divisional partnerships. Teams focussed their energy on a range of important research issues supporting the AFSC mission including fishing tagging, fisheries survey design and preparation, marine mammals, genetics, shellfish, and fish life history. All of the teams developed their skills for improved analysis workflows, report writing, and manuscript preparation; promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration; intentional investment in on- and off-boarding processes; and integrated project management. All of this was achieved within the context of an expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community. The support and enthusiasm of AFSC leadership for AFSC to develop new skills and best practices is critical to AFSC’s continued organizational excellence.\n\nBefore openscapes, our group had the beginnings of some momentum to create general, centralized protocols and analysis pipelines. The openscapes program really pushed us to the next level and gave us ideas of how to implement what we were thinking of designing for our group. Our advisor has supported us taking time to continue working on this organization and really cares about reproducibility. We are set up well to continue implementing our repos and shared resources.\n\n\n\nPacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\nAs our first time working with Openscapes, PIFSC staff across all four science divisions participated in the Fall Cohorts. Three of the PIFSC teams gave progress presentations at the final session. Highlights including the introduction of the Protected Species Division Open Science Hub (Figure 2), a clear vision of enhanced reproducibility, collaboration, and team culture from the Ecosystem Sciences Division team, and an improved pathway for processing published datasets from the Fisheries Research and Monitoring Division Life History Program team.\nWhile some PIFSC staff have been committed to open science for some time, there is growing momentum to make these practices more widespread at PIFSC. Openscapes participants have been equipped with tools and a community to begin or continue practicing open science. We are sharing what we learned with our broader work teams, and plans are in motion to showcase PIFSC open science at a seminar in Spring 2023. Momentum is building to modernize our workflows and products. However, more capacity and training will be needed. In an email to Ecosystem Sciences Division leadership expressing support for future Openscapes training, Research Oceanographer Phoebe Woodworth-Jefcoats stated that Openscapes training was \n\nhands down the best training I’ve had in my 15+ years with NOAA.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The PIFSC Protected Species Division team created a newGitHub Organization andinformation hub (using Quarto).\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\nThis is the third Openscapes training that SEFSC scientists have participated in. The Fall 2022 cohort  expanded this open science movement to every division in our Center. We have continued to build out tools initiated by previous participants, increasing our efficiencies and engagement in collaborative project management with GitHub project boards. The Population and Ecosystems Monitoring Division’s Trawl and Plankton Branch plans to expand their use of GitHub for cruise planning and version control programming to process and analyze cruise data (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The SEFSC Trawl and Plankton Branch team focused on “Where are we going and how do we get there”, and plans to do better documentation, use GitHub, which in the near-term involves setting up discussions to include more team members and set up collaborative processes.\n\n\n\nSEFSC staff are building repositories of standard scripts and incorporating better review of data products, leveraging the Git version control software in the SEFSC Organization under the NOAA-NMFS GitHub Enterprise. Our GitHub Organization facilitates collaboration and onboarding and centralizes our intellectual property under unified NMFS standard operating procedures.\n\n\nSouthwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\nThis was the first time researchers from SWFSC participated in Openscapes! In her post for the NOAA Fisheries Science Blog, Biological Science Technician Kourtney Burger talked about the value of having Seaside Chats with her Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab (SAEL) team and connecting with peers at other Centers.\n\nI transferred our recently revamped ADRIFT Field Methods manual to a Quarto web book. Previously, it was sitting in a google drive where it wasn’t easy to find and had accessibility issues. In just a couple hours, I was able to easily make a new repository, copy a Quarto template, and transfer the google document to a GitHub repository and an easy to navigate website!\n\n\n\nNorthwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC)\nThis was the third Openscapes training that NWFSC scientists have participated in and as for previous Cohorts, this was a joint training with other offices. This provided a diversity of perspectives and helped participants understand the similarity and differences of data science tasks and challenges across the agency. A number of teams were participating for their second or third time and came with clear goals concerning improving workflows for the team’s large complex reports.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: NWFSC Ecosystem Status Report Automation team was united by working on reports with many contributors of maps, time series data that must be compiled into 20-page reports."

    "text": "Conclusion\nNOAA Fisheries is embracing cultural and technological evolution in our transition to open science. As part of this, we are taking strides towards standard best practices and secure IT workflows as it relates to internally and publicly sharing our scientific products, both in development and implementation. NOAA Fisheries scientists have put together a GitHub Vision Document and are working towards a GitHub Governance Team to pull what works from each Science Center. The result of these efforts will lead to a nationwide standard of more secure workflows, potentially more cost effective purchasing of tools, and more equitable distribution of these resources.\nWe’ve proposed additional partnerships with Openscapes via a 3-year grant proposal (with co-PI Holmes) that would further advance this movement. By creating more intentional opportunities (i.e. time and space) to seek and share guidance from one another, we inherently give our teammates a leg up on our respective starting points. When we critically and empathetically examine our workflows across teams, we foster an inclusive and psychologically safe work environment. We’re excited that the White House has declared 2023 as the Year of Open Science and to be part of this broader movement across government and science. \nThanks for reading! Please join us on January 26 at the ESIP Winter Meeting, where two of us - Adyan Rios (SEFSC) and Josh London (AFSC) - will share the success of movement building inside NOAA Fisheries, on a panel discussing “Better science for future us: Openscapes stories and approaches for the Year of Open Science”. Look for a follow-up blog and recording about this too!"

    "text": "AFSC Champions Cohort summary\nWe worked with Jeremy Rusin to bring the Openscapes Champions Program to AFSC, which included 8 teams. The teams consisted of 41 AFSC employees from 5 AFSC divisions and the Alaska Regional Office. All of the teams developed their skills for improved analysis workflows, report writing and manuscript preparation, promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration, intentional investment in on- and off-boarding processes, better collaboration with academic and state governments, and integrated project management. All of this was achieved within the context of a growing expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community. \nFor each of the teams, the Openscapes training was just the beginning of a longer process. It is essential that AFSC leadership, division directors, and supervisors continue to offer the support, time, space, and enthusiasm as teams continue to develop skills and implement meaningful new practices. Participants in the training also recognize the need for additional training in specific skills and technologies (e.g., R, Python, Git and GitHub, advanced Google Workspace, reproducible analysis, collaborative writing). The AFSC can provide support for these needs by both identifying and funding training opportunities, and by encouraging scientists to allocate work time for expanding knowledge and expertise through free resources and self-directed training.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an Openscapes pathway written by the EcoFOCI team. The diagram summarizes how they used to share code, data, and files, and what their ongoing plans are for streamlining these processes and creating a team culture of openness and psychological safety.\n\n\n\nParticipants from the AFSC Openscapes cohort found the training transformative for their professional development. The training created a supportive forum for continued learning and collaboration across programs and divisions. As mentors for the AFSC Openscapes cohort, we are committed to the community of support and active learning environment established during the training. We feel confident in stating AFSC’s continued investment in Openscapes will establish AFSC scientists as leaders in open science, enhance collaborations across divisions and centers, ensure continuity of long-term research efforts, and improve scientific communication to all stakeholders. Everyone involved in the cohort looks forward to expanded Openscapes training opportunities in the near future.\nThe 2022 Openscapes cohort training took place over 5 remote calls from January 28 to March 11, 2022. Cohort calls covered: \n1) setting the open science mindset and discussing psychological safety, \n2) an introduction to publishing and project management on GitHub, \n3) instituting team culture and data strategies (Tidy Data), \n4) developing open communities and coding strategies (RMarkdown and Quarto), and \n5) preparing a team pathway document to guide their open data science journey after the training."

Cohort members were interested to hear from AFSC leadership about how the Board of Directors, program leads, and supervisors plan to support staff in learning these new skills and applying them in the future.\nEstablishing best practices across science centers for sharing large, confidential datasets with collaborators without having collaborators interact directly with internal databases. These challenges are not unique to AFSC and would benefit from cross-center collaboration.\nAllocating time for implementing open data science practices into performance plans by making the development of open science strategies and skills central to an employees’ priority activities and not an additional task relegated to ‘spare time’. \nIncluding contractors in trainings (like Openscapes) in the future, so that research teams can participate in full.\nContinued development of user-driven connections, communication, and collaborative learning between centers and between divisions at AFSC, including a focus on psychological safety. \nAdditional and specific technical training in RMarkdown, GitHub, RStudio Connect, public data sharing and team-building skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nA zoom view of the 2022 AFSC Openscapes Cohort!"

This team includes Lauren Rogers (@larogers123), Jesse Lamb (@jesseflamb), Kelia Axler (@keliaaxler), Ali Deary (@AlisonDeary-NOAA), and David Kimmel (@kimmeld09). Before Openscapes, the team felt that tight timelines forced the team to work “quickly; not always carefully” and that the Openscapes training gave them space to explore easier, faster, and more consistent ways to prepare results. The team created a GitHub organization to help them codify data and code, and more importantly, invest in culture change. The team heavily discussed establishing a culture of modeling openness, sharing early code, and asking for expertise. The team aptly phrased the latter as “hidden expertise,” as the expertise may exist, but on local computers and unbeknownst to their peers, forcing others to reinvent workflows and processes that were already established. \nThe Marine Mammal Stock Assessments Team aims to streamline the development, review, and publication of the annual Alaska marine mammal stock assessment reports. This team includes Nancy Young (@nancycyoung), Brian Fadely (@BFadely), Rod Towell (@rtowell), Tony Orr (@Tony-Orr), and Erin Richmond (@erinrichmond). Through Openscapes, the team used GitHub, a new GitHub organization, wikis, and R Markdown to establish processes for preparing data and analyses, tackle outdated version control workflows, and improve on and offboarding procedures. The team focused on developing one SAR in R Markdown as a proof of concept. The team found that seaside chats spurred open discussion and idea sharing and plan to keep meeting after Openscapes. \nThe Groundfish Food Habits Team is focused on streamlining reproducible flow of code and data to provide food habits and model data to ESRs, ESPs, and stock assessments. This team includes Kerim Aydin (@kaydin-NOAA), Kirstin Holsman, Bridget Ferriss (@BridgetFerriss), Geoff Lang (@geofflang-NOAA), and Jonathan Reum. The team found that writing out the pathways document helped confirm next overarching steps for the group, that there were changes that needed to happen in their workflow, and that they needed to establish best practices. In an effort to foster a culture of reuse, the team started and tested out a GitHub organization and other avenues for collaboration so they can find the best platform forward for their unique team’s needs. \nThe Shellfish Assessment Program Team is focused on 1) improving annual Tech Memo and 2) improving collaboration on bitter crab disease reports. This team included Mike Litzow (@mikelitzow), Jonathan Richar (@JonRichar-NOAA), Erin Fedewa (@Erin-Fedewa-NOAA), Leah Zacher (@LeahZacher-NOAA), and Jen Gardner (@JenniferGardner-NOAA). Through the Openscapes program, the team devised a plan for accessing raw data, to data wrangling, to preparing tech memo figures. With their new GitHub organization, they had the tools to start earnest discussions on how to document their work. \nThe AFSC Stock Assessment Team’s overarching goal is to 1) create reproducible stock assessments and streamline reporting and presenting to Council bodies (specific project could be to take two assessments as examples: arrowtooth flounder and northern rockfish), 2) improve data to modeling to reporting for economic models, 3) create consistent fishery data sources across science and management, and 4) discuss of CFI implementation. This team includes Kalei Shotwell (@kshotwell), Meaghan Bryan (@mdbryan), Jim Ianelli (@jimianelli-NOAA), Ben Williams (@BenWilliams-NOAA), Chris Lunsford (@chrislunsford-NOAA), Alan Haynie (@alanhaynie-NOAA), and Anne Hollowed. Openscapes motivated the group to develop the Stock Modeling and Assessment Reproducibility Team (SMART), a supporting SOP, and a GitHub organization. SMART combines the two stock assessment teams and coordinates regular meetings and overarching goals for the effort. Through SMART, the team presented at the Informal Stock Assessment Advances in Methods meeting (March 1 and 3) on their openscapes work and conducted a survey in part to figure out where they could better support their peer stock assessors. \nTrophic Roles of Ice Seals RWP Team aims to develop a new Regional Work Plan-funded project to estimate the consumption of dominant prey by ice-associated seals in the Bering and Chukchi seas that would involve collaborators within and beyond NOAA. This team includes Stacie Hardy (@staciekozhardy), Peter Boveng (@PeterBoveng-NOAA), Heather Ziel (@zielhl), Michael Cameron (@MichaelCameron-NOAA), and Johanna Vollenweider (@JohannaPage-NOAA). The team felt that Openscapes created a space for members to collect thoughts, define a more efficient and thoughtful workflow ecosystem (e.g., tidyverse) to work within, and start planning how they can share what they learned and hope to implement with their larger group. The team worked on how their new GitHub Organization could help them work with external collaborators and instill version control as projects evolve. The team felt that working though this example project provided them with a universal framework that can be transferred to other existing projects. \nThe Fisheries Monitoring Team is focused on improving the Annual Deployment Plan analytic and report production workflow and result sharing with council, stock assessors and the public. This team includes Craig Faunce (@CraigFaunce-NOAA), Phil Ganz (@philganz), Jennifer Cahalan (@JenCahalan-NOAA), and Geoff Mayhew (@geoffmmayhew). Galvanized by Openscapes’ GitHub tutorial and an endeavor to streamline the onboarding and offboarding process, the team has begun moving much of their dataset wrangling scripts and issue tracking to GitHub. The team has also begun developing standard datasets for everyone to use in easy to access locations. \nThe Midwater Pollock Assessment Team aims to create a reproducible and transparent abundance analysis and reporting process for the management of midwater walleye pollock data in Alaska. This team includes Mike Levine (@mike-levine), Sarah Stienessen (@sstienessen), Nate Lauffenburger (@nlauffenburger), Sam Urmy (@ElOceanografo), and Abigail McCarthy (@abigailatsea). This team used their time with Openscapes to explore the best project management platform for their team and survey preparation, realizing that trello and smartsheets gave the team the flexibility they needed. The team also began automating cruise reports with R Markdown. The team next plans on providing a demonstration and presentation to the rest of their larger group as they start planning for their summer survey."

This event remotely convened a wide spectrum of biomedical open data science leaders to discuss how Openscapes could meet biomedical community needs. Openscapes’ roots are in environmental science but there has been increasing interest in becoming involved from the biomedical communities as well. This event started the conversation on topics we should consider to serve and strengthen biomedical and other communities more broadly. We have learned a tremendous amount from Mozilla Open Leaders and followed their best practices, including a stated code of conduct and multiple channels for participation, to create an inclusive space where everyone felt empowered to learn, share and ask questions."

    "text": "Goal 1: Get to know each other through sharing leadership experiences\nDue to COVID, the event was down-sized to a 2-hour call, so this asynchronous pre-work enabled us to reduce the synchronous time together. An exciting group of advisors (full list below) did “prework” before the meeting to get a sense of Openscapes’ vision, program, and momentum. This minimized spending in-person time on background in favor of hearing more from every participant.\nThe pre-work included everyone preparing a 5 minute statement where they shared with the group 1) an introduction to the person their work, their communities, their vision; 2) something they think/do/use/know that has improved their work, leadership, or impact that would benefit this group (could be process, technology, a cautionary tale…) and 3) what is the hardest part of your work. (The idea for that last question came from Kirstie Whitaker during a conversation at MozFest 2019).\nFolks shared really interesting stories and perspectives building from their work. They lead trainings for researchers as well as for leadership, and build and support learning communities like Life Science Trainers, BioData Club, H3ABioNet, ASBCB, Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers, LIBD rstats club, Mozilla Open Leaders, and E2M2: Ecological and Epidemiological Modeling in Madagascar. From their statements we discussed further as a full group, asking questions, finding synergies, and developing a better understanding of some of the different approaches and efforts going on in this space."

    "section": "Goal 2: Reflect on themes and shared needs",
    "text": "Goal 2: Reflect on themes and shared needs\nPerhaps the biggest recurring theme was the importance of community. We talked about this from a leadership perspective in terms of the importance of letting other people in and a mindset where you can learn from anyone. This attitude is key to an inclusive program and they are a critical sustainability strategy as well. Finding ways to center community building is the way to make efforts more sustainable. Including others means you getting more comfortable sharing imperfect work and delegating is a great way to train & level-up community members to take on more leadership.\nAnother theme was how working in open data and open science spaces brings up feelings of loneliness, not fitting into a ‘normal’ domain, shame or ‘not doing it right’. And how these feelings lead naturally into conversations around empathy, resilience and collaboration. Kindness and thinking more deeply about what you DO bring to the table is a helpful strategy.\nWe talked about engaging with different audiences and the importance of curating information: the need to both communicate information AND protect people from (irrelevant or distracting) information. This means curating information and annotating it for different audiences to help them make better decisions as they engage. This is particularly important to foster buy-in from leadership that supports the time and effort involved for others to learn.\nAnother topic was about how research groups are often not trying to do open science – they are trying to make their analytical experience less painful. This brought up the idea of the “trojan horse”: meeting analytical needs but also introducing open science practices at the same time. This also tied into how providing motivation is a big part of our work, and how important storytelling is for motivation. Sharing your learning path, and showing humility and vulnerability, can be some of the best traits in a teacher."

    "text": "Goal 3: how to improve Openscapes going forward\nAs break-out groups we focused on specific questions for Openscapes: What gaps or opportunities do you see for Openscapes? What could make Openscapes better suited for biomed communities? What existing needs do you see as unfilled in your biomed communities?\nWe talked about time as a big issue; how to help folks prioritize Openscapes/open data science with their other responsibilities? Advice here was to focus on the value exchange: illustrate how it’s worth the time spent, and be clear what they’ll be getting out of it. This means being very cognisant of the cost/labor involved in participation being very explicit of offering incentives and rewards. Encouraging people to make community activities and learning part of their job instead of something extra. With storytelling, focus on what the journey could look like for research teams: Your lab is doing A, B, C, this is what the journey to D, E, F looks like. On the other hand, you don’t want people to overcommit. So in addition to the value exchange, perhaps there is a lightweight version of Openscapes that could have different levels of lessons, messaging, intensity, etc.\nWe also discussed that identifying and naming explicit roles can be very effective – both at events but also within research teams.\nProgrammatically, we need to focus on what makes Openscapes unique, and communicating that it has staying power. People love to spin up new stuff but is this initiative going to stick around?"

There is a lot more to reflect on but one of the biggest take-homes for me was around communicating the vision and the services Openscapes provides, and how it fits in and complements other existing efforts. And also thinking about the value exchanges for participants. Engaging in open data science is not only about time and effort – which are substantial – but also about changing the way we’ve been working for our whole careers. Both time and change are hard, so how can we really focus on meeting scientists where they are and providing them with what they need."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last month I was invited to give a workshop at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Essential Open Source Software virtual conference. The workshop was about Audience Building for Open Source Projects, focused on strategic planning and sustainability. I was both nervous and excited to give this workshop: nervous because I am by no means an expert in how to grow and sustain a project — Openscapes is still nascent! But I was excited because although I am not an expert, I do know a lot and was interested to pass forward what I’ve learned. This post is a quick overview and a summary of participant activites.\nQuick links:\n\nslides\n#EOSSmtg\n\n\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Essential Open Source Software program supports and connects folks building open source software for science. I was very excited to attend to meet folks and learn about the cool things they are developing. And, I was excited to see a keynote by Kate Bouman, whose team used open algorithms and open data to “make” the first image of a black hole!\nI was invited to give a workshop about audience building and strategic planning for open source projects. Here is the abstract I wrote for the workshop:\n\nOpen source software is about more than code: it’s about welcoming a broadening audience to a shared vision and planning for sustainability. We’ll cover considerations for open source programs including messaging & “marketing”, onboarding, inclusion, community building, web presence & technology choices, and fundraising, using Openscapes strategies as a starting example.\n\nI framed the workshop in broad categories: communication, community building, and sustainability. We talked about each category in turn, although the process is not linear, it’s iterative, reinforcing, and overlapping. Essentially, there are many things to do at the same time that are all linked together. And the overarching themes that come up throughout the whole process — built into everything you do, into every decision you make — is openness, inclusion, and maintenance. So, for every decision you make, you should ask yourself: am I being as open as I can be, am I being as inclusive as I can be, and will I be able to maintain what I’m starting. This will help prioritize where you put your efforts.\n\n\n\n\n \nI have learned so much from my mentors and many open projects that I have been introduced to in the past several years. I highlighted the main resources that frame my thinking for how I think about audience building:\n\nMozilla Open Leaders\n\nOpen Leadership Training Series\nWork Open, Lead Open (#WOLO)\nMovement building from home\n\nScientific Gateways Community Institute\n\nsciencegateways.org\nFocus Weeks\nCase Studies\n\nOpen Source Alliance for Open Scholarship\n\nHandbook\n\n\nI put additional references on each of the slides that you can refer to to learn more. I also had 3 silent activities throughout the workshop for folks to reflect on each of the categories we talked through. The first activity asked folks to respond in chat: What is a potential next step for you in terms of communication (audience, messaging, web)? Here are some of the responses:\n\nBlogs and/or guided lessons on how to use our tool\nMaking our homepage messaging more inclusive for our various audiences\nDrafting a Slack community and user guide to share on our community Slack\nTutorials\nUser survey\nEmail newsletter for communication.\nRe-thinking our community forum structure, in order to incentivize more people to engage and reward them for helping others\nVideo onboarding\nUpdate our website, regular communication to community through newsletter, social media\nRedesigning the website, driven by specific user groups!\n\n\nThe second activity used Abby Cabunoc Mayes’ Mountain of Engagement image along with the “stamp” feature in Zoom: participants placed a stamp or drawing where they felt their project lands on this mountain. This was fun to see happen live! There are a lot of folks transitioning into Sustained Participation, Networked Participation, and Leadership:\n\n\n\n\nThe Mountain of Engagement from Abby Cabunoc Mayes’ talk at the CZI EOSS kickoff meeting:  Work Open, Lead Open (#WOLO)\n\n\n\nThe final activity asked folks to write responses in chat to the question: How could you use help with sustainability (strategic planning, governance, and onboarding)?\n\nGovernance is the biggest question-mark in my org\nChallenges about gracefully moving back and forth between cycles of high-level strategic planning, and low-level “getting things done on the daily”\nSetting aside time to explicitly do this work. It tends to drop down the list of to-dos\nWe need to test business models for longer term sustainability.\nDefine and stick to a roadmap, and better communicate it with the community (and how expected timelines depend on contributions and funding)\nHow do you convince project members that governance is worth discussing before the project has scaled up to the point where governance is clearly needed?\nMaking onboarding easy\nConsidering the most efficient way to do a gap analysis to inform these difference facets.\n\nIt was great to be able to chat further with the participants about these topics so that we can share insights and tackle them together. Thanks again to CZI for the invitation to lead this workshop: it was really fun to put together — and it helped me clarify things in my own head — and I appreciate all the engaged participants!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cross-posted at emLab\nThis is a guest post from Darcy Bradley, marine ecologist and Research Director of the Environmental Market Solution Lab’s Ocean Program at UC Santa Barbara. A leader in many realms, Darcy is thrilled to be a part of a community that celebrates open and reproducible data science; this post provides a glimpse into how she engaged that community to help her and her team improve project and data management for her research group.\n\nOne year ago, I wrote a blog post about the exciting role big data promises to play in revolutionizing natural resource management. Indeed, our research program has rapidly evolved to take advantage of the huge amounts of information made available by new technologies and clever data platforms. While this exciting transition has enabled us to ask questions that weren’t even imaginable just a few short years ago, our increasing reliance on externally sourced data, expanded collaborative networks, and high powered computing infrastructure to handle increasingly complex analyses has not been without growing pains. The imperative for a thoughtful and standardized data infrastructure was something we could no longer ignore.\nSo this is a story of our journey from opaque project structures to standardized, transparent, and version controlled workflows. It’s a story of learning from others, leveraging our team’s extensive data science and project management expertise, and working to build a streamlined and thoughtful data infrastructure. Ultimately, it’s a story that can best be told through the lessons we’ve learned along the way.\nLesson 1. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Fortunately for us, Santa Barbara is no stranger to open data science and innovative project management. Our friends and neighbors at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) – and their Ocean Health Index team in particular – are global leaders in open environmental data science. Senior Fellow and Data Scientist Dr. Julia Stewart Lowndes has been at the forefront of NCEAS’s pioneering open science efforts, recently founding Openscapes to train others in open science practices to enable “better science in less time.” Julie became our data streamlining guru – she quickly identified that we ought to consider crafting a data management standard operating procedure (offering her team’s SOP as an example) and provided resources and guidance to set us on our way.\nLesson 2. Collaborative science is the best science. To effectively create a new vision for our internal data infrastructure, we knew we needed to draw on the wide range of expertise from our team. A self-assembled group of data managers, project researchers, and project managers began to meet regularly to map out an aspirational data and project management infrastructure. We reflected upon the collaborative software platforms, open data science, and project management tools that worked best for our team. We recorded best practices for file structure, naming, data storage, and metadata and thought through script standardization and version control. We assembled how-to guides for leveraging high performance computing resources of ever growing importance for our memory intensive analyses. Importantly, we connected the dots between our workstreams to actualize our vision of a fully integrated data management system, which we collaboratively documented in the emLab Standard Operating Procedure. And then we turned it loose, inviting the entire emLab community to participate in a one day Data Hackathon to document and migrate our data inputs, outputs, and repositories to our now centralized and streamlined data system.\n\n\n\n\nemLabers hard at work during our one day data Hackathon\n\n\n\nLesson 3. Iterate and evolve. Our SOP is a living document that will continue to evolve as we do. There is an ebb and flow to the chatter on our “data-streamlining” Slack channel but we are collectively committed to continually improving our data practices and our SOP as needs arise. We’ve learned that a commitment to better data management takes time and effort, but the payoff is immediate. Our SOP is the centerpiece of our onboarding process, and our improved data infrastructure has already been leveraged to synthesize vast and disparate elements of global fisheries data into a user-friendly, interactive online tool. As a team committed to conducting research for real-world impact, our approach is inherently outward looking, forward thinking, and often based on externally generated sources of information. Our journey to re-envision our data infrastructure required us to reflect instead on our internal processes, to tear them apart and collectively rebuild something better, something more thoughtful and transparent, a new system that affirms our commitment to open and reproducible data science."

This ability to openly share your work has been transformational for Openscapes, and played a foundational role in the whole design and how we work on a daily basis (see related: Data science as an entryway to open publishing, Lowndes & Tierney 2020)\n\nThere was a lot conversation in the chat and also discussed out loud as a Q&A with Alison. One big theme was about modularization and how to keep R Markdown documents from becoming too unruly. Strategies included writing R code in functions or separate scripts that are called into the R Markdown document through a code chunk, or writing child documents that are knit into the main document.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs always, it was a pleasure to chat with Alison! Looking forward for further chats. Thanks so much for all you do!"

Our country is facing a reckoning and we need to take individual and collective action to fight for justice and anti-racism.\n\nI have been slow to speak out, focused on listening and learning and understanding my role in systemic anti-Black racism, including in academia and environmental science and data science. And trying to figure out what I can do to support ongoing efforts for racial justice and true change. I have been quiet, worried that I’ll say the wrong thing. But silence is part of the problem. We all need to be deliberately and actively and tirelessly anti-racist. We need to listen, act as supportive allies, and fight for Black lives. So I commit to speaking up and doing better. And Openscapes will do better, to show up for racial justice and for true change."

    "text": "Better science for future us\nThe start of Fall is nearly here and with the season change and back to school, we are reflecting on Openscapes’ work over the Summer and where we are headed this Fall. Several presentations this summer provided the opportunity to hone in on the language that our work is about “better science for future us”. “Better science” means science that is more open, reproducible, efficient, and also more diverse, equitable, inclusive, kind. And “future us” is ourselves, teams, communities in the next hour, week, decades – with a focus on onboarding ourselves and others to ongoing work.\nWe have now led 5 Champions cohorts with 35 research teams (and have 3 more starting - see below!). And we are seeing that the Champions program goals supporting better science for future us – like empowering open, team practices to accelerate data-driven research and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science – are happening! Teams are creating GitHub Organizations for sharing code, conversations, and codes of conduct, and these practices are also now showing up in publications (e.g. Bastille et al 2021). They are also facilitating and teaching based on what Erin and I have learned and role model through Openscapes. Our work really centers on the common: discussing data workflows, identifying and addressing shared needs, and thinking ahead in an inclusive way while spending less time reinventing.\nThe summer was a reflective time for us. And we have been thinking about future us by creating the Openscapes Approach Guide! This is our ongoing contribution to helping future us as we continue to run Champions and Mentor Cohorts, and for future us that expands to other organizations that want to run their own Champions cohorts.\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Approach Guide, v0.0.1"

We are advocates and supporters of open data in the agency and the water data community and have recently expanded this work to include advancing open science principles and building data literacy in the Water Boards as a whole.\nWhen we first heard about Openscapes, we wanted to learn more about their process and figure out how we could bring the Openscapes mindset to the Water Boards and our diverse network of partners and collaborators.

    "section": "What did we learn & what are we doing now?",
    "text": "What did we learn & what are we doing now?\nWhen we agreed to be Openscapes mentors, we hoped that we would gain exposure to the overall Openscapes process including the logistics behind preparing for and supporting cohorts. We also wanted to spend time thinking about how we, as individuals, could integrate Openscapes practices and tools into our work. We got all of that and SO. MUCH. MORE!\nAfter our first preparatory conversation with Julie and Erin, our minds were full of ideas about how we could incorporate Openscapes tools, processes, and workflows into our daily work. One day Julie screenshared to show us how to use the R package Distill to create an event page for the FDD Cohort. We were then able to create the NMFS page on our own, and push it as a draft to GitHub so it was waiting for her to publish it. Not only seeing this was possible for the first time but then doing it ourselves really helped us see how this could be implemented in our own work. Plus, it was neat to collaborate so easily and use familiar technology (R) for writing, communication, and publishing. Corey was able to roll up a github.io webpage for an (at the time) upcoming California Trash Data Dive within days of that meeting. Anna began looking into how we could streamline, document, and automate our reporting and communication workflows. We haven’t developed any products for that work just yet - but conversations have begun and we plan on strategically implementing updated workflows in 2022!\nAs mentors we have been able to observe and support the FDD and NMFS cohorts, and we also learned a lot by hearing the discussions participants were having with their own messy/confidential/big data and contribute to those conversations with our own experience. Through that process we have learned and internalized some key lessons:\n\nOpenscapes is a mindset At first glance, Openscapes can seem like a sort of coding training series. While discussions and skill building opportunities (guest speakers, GitHub clinics, seaside chats, co-working sessions) make space for technical conversations and troubleshooting, the overall process is really about workflows. Openscapes provides a space and a structure for teams to temporarily pause their regular work discussions so they have the time and mental bandwidth to think through and talk about how they work, and how they can do it more openly, accessibly, and efficiently. Many of us might go through that sort of process on an individual level, but making space to have those conversations within and across teams - especially if individuals are from different organizations or agencies - can drastically broaden conversations and result in more holistic and streamlined solutions and communication pathways.\nWe are not alone! The datasets, details, and contexts around the work we do might be different - and that can often be the focus when we’re from the Water Boards and others are in the Fisheries Service. But the data and workflow challenges are remarkably similar, and when we discuss these challenges (and solutions!) together we can learn from each other and waste a whole lot less time than when we try to tackle the problems alone in our silos. Taking the time to increase the openness and transparency of our workflows helps improve processes and practices so they are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind.\nOnboarding can (and should!) be so much more than finding the bathroom All of us have gone through some form of an onboarding process: meet the team, meet with HR to complete your I-9 and health insurance forms, find your desk and, yes, find the bathroom. But how many of us are able to utilize that process to explicitly learn about work culture/expectations, and given an easy, one-stop-shop manual that describes how to find the data and resources relevant to our work, and how to add/contribute to those resources over time so that it’s up-to-date and augmented with our perspective for the next person. Dedicating time to think through and document the components of your workflow that are described in the Openscapes Pathway document can help streamline onboarding and offboarding processes as well as serve as a resource and reminder to folks that have been on the team for a while (including future us!). Better still - there are already a number of past Openscapes teams that have developed these types of documents in an open format that can be used as a template or inspiration for any documentation you want to create (Faylab Manual = GOLD)!\nGoing through the Openscapes process is an investment Many of us are already juggling too many things in the work we do and the thought of adding another ball in the air can feel daunting…impossible even. It does take time and energy to go through the Openscapes process. This is not a passive experience (i.e. it’s not a webinar or a meeting to show up to). Getting everything you can out of Openscapes requires active engagement during calls and working together in between calls, which teams do through Seaside Chats. Giving ourselves and our teams the time and space to do so can significantly improve workflows and efficiency immediately and down the road. The potential returns on this investment in time and focus are massive - IF we, as individuals and as teams, fully commit ourselves to the process."

    "text": "What did “assisting” look like for us?\nWhen Julie and Erin asked us to be mentors they let us determine the depth and breadth of that commitment. We could choose to take a light touch approach or we could dive in, but they were clear that we wouldn’t be “shadowing” - we would be assisting through contributing to the cohort during, before, and after calls. This meant that we’d learn by doing, which is exactly what we were hoping for since we wanted to use the experience to prepare ourselves to lead our own Cohort at the Water Boards.\nWe have some experience with meeting and event facilitation so we know from personal experience that getting one additional person to provide simple tech support or help with note taking can significantly lighten the load for the main meeting facilitator and speakers during the meeting. Moreover, providing that assistance doesn’t take that much preparation or time so long as we are available during the meeting time - we were happy to take on those roles during Cohort calls.\nBecause of our interest in learning as much as we could about the logistics of leading or supporting the Openscapes process at the Water Boards, we choose to take on a little more than the minimum mentor responsibilities. We elected to take the lead on writing up the meeting summaries (Digests) after each cohort call and attend Seaside Chats with Julie, Erin, and other mentors before the beginning of the cohorts, in between cohort calls, and after the last cohort call. Writing up the Digests did take some time but because Julie and Erin already have templates and examples for everything (seriously…everything!) adding this to our mentor workload didn’t feel like a heavy lift. The Seaside Chats were hands-on training opportunities for us. Julie and Erin walked us through the Openscapes process, prepared us for any upcoming mentor responsibilities, shared resources, and made time for skill building - we even got our own GitHub clinic! Julie and Erin said this was a great opportunity for them to practice since they were iterating the order and length of the GitHub Clinic.\nCommitting time and energy to assist with Openscapes Champions Cohorts is not inconsequential - but it feels like a bargain! We get to observe Openscapes pros do their amazing work, learn from their expertise and resources, and connect with and learn from cohort speakers and teams for only 1-3 hours of commitment each week. This table shows our time commitments for 2021, and this will be the starting point as we develop plans for 2022 as well!\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\nTime commitment\n\n\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nSeaside chats\n\n(pre-cohort)\n\n\n1 hour/chat; 3 chats total\n\n\nEvery other week (started 2 months before Cohort Calls)\n\n\n\n\nCohort Calls & GitHub Clinic (logistical support)\n\n\n1.5 hours/call; 4 calls total\n\n\nEvery other week (alternating with Seaside chats)\n\n\n\n\nCohort Digests\n\n\n~1.5 hrs/Digest; 4 total\n\n\nEvery other week, a day or so after each Cohort Call\n\n\n\n\nSeaside chats\n\n(during & post-cohort)\n\n\n1 hour/call; 6 chats total\n\n\nEvery other week (ended 2 months after the last Cohort Call)"
