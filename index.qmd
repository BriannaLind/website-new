# **WHAT WE DO**
:::

**At Openscapes, we champion open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster.** Regardless of research question, environmental scientists are united by the need to analyze data --- and to do so in a way that is efficient, reproducible, and easily communicated. With tools specifically created to meet modern demands for collaborative data science, we help create a positive open culture to enable better science in less time. [Our approach](approach.qmd):

**ENGAGE**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We build awareness and excitement.** We engage scientists with the possibilities of open data science with empathy, art, and storytelling, using narratives like our own [path to better science in less time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)

**EMPOWER**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We help build confidence and skills.** We empower scientists by connecting them with existing open software and communities that meet them where they are so they can develop the skills they need.

**AMPLIFY**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We build champions and communities.** We amplify scientists’ efforts through academic seminars as well as blogs and social media to increase the visibility of open practices on campus and online.
