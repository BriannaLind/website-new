# **WHAT WE DO**
:::

<br>
**Openscapes is an [approach](approach.qmd) and a movement to support better science in less time, together.** As part of the larger open science movement, we help research teams and organizations reimagine data-intensive science as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Here's how:

{{< fa users title="Three people" >}}
:::
::: {.blue-text .medium-body-text}
**ENGAGE**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We welcome and create space and place.** We engage researchers who want to work better and collaborate through empathy, art, storytelling, and technology.

**EMPOWER**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We invest in learning and trust, and work openly.** We empower researchers by growing their confidence and abilities as they put what they learn into practice quickly.

**AMPLIFY**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We leverage common workflows and inspire broader shifts.** We amplify progress through collaboration and reuse, celebrating people and small wins that accumulate.

# **GROWING THE OPEN MOVEMENT**
:::
<br>
We help research groups focused on the cascading impacts of climate change develop collaborative daily workflows that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind while they connect to the growing open science movement. We call this **kinder science for future us**. Learn more about our [initiatives](initiatives.qmd) and [impact](impact.qmd), and [connect](connect.qmd) with us.

<!---
We work at the intersection of actionable environmental science, open source, and data science, motivated to empower and connect groups working to mitigate the cascading impacts of climate change. Our focus is mentoring researchers and those who support research and growing the open movement around the world.

“Openscapes has created a collaborative environment for DAAC staff to collectively support open science initiatives for NASA Earthdata users. We’ve developed awesome material to help Earthdata users. Perhaps just as important as what we’ve done however, are mindsets we’ve grown into along the way. It’s okay to share imperfect works in progress. We are better at dreaming and implementing the future together.”

“As fisheries scientists, we know that when we’re in rough seas, it’s important to keep the ship afloat AND get out of the storm. Openscapes helps teams steer out of the storm of email chains with 37 versions of the same spreadsheet and to the calmer waters of open science and meaningful collaboration, using tools like R.”
