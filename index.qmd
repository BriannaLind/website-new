# **WHAT WE DO**
:::

**At Openscapes, we champion open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster.** Regardless of research question, environmental scientists are united by the need to analyze data --- and to do so in a way that is efficient, reproducible, and easily communicated. With tools specifically created to meet modern demands for collaborative data science, we help create a positive open culture to enable better science in less time. [Our approach](approach.qmd):

**ENGAGE**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We build awareness and excitement.** We engage scientists with the possibilities of open data science with empathy, art, and storytelling, using narratives like our own [path to better science in less time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)

**EMPOWER**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We help build confidence and skills.** We empower scientists by connecting them with existing open software and communities that meet them where they are so they can develop the skills they need.

**AMPLIFY**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We build champions and communities.** We amplify scientists’ efforts through academic seminars as well as blogs and social media to increase the visibility of open practices on campus and online.

# **GROWING THE OPEN MOVEMENT**
:::

We help research groups focused on the cascading impacts of climate change develop inclusive daily workflows and connect to the growing open movement. Learn more about our [initiatives](initiatives.qmd) and our [impact](impact.qmd). 

<!---
We work at the intersection of actionable environmental science, open source, and data science, motivated to empower and connect groups working to mitigate the cascading impacts of climate change. Our focus is mentoring researchers and those who support research and growing the open movement around the world.

> “Openscapes has created a collaborative environment for DAAC staff to collectively support open science initiatives for NASA Earthdata users. We’ve developed awesome material to help Earthdata users. Perhaps just as important as what we’ve done however, are mindsets we’ve grown into along the way. It’s okay to share imperfect works in progress. We are better at dreaming and implementing the future together.”  
– Cassandra Nickles, NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC)

> “As fisheries scientists, we know that when we’re in rough seas, it’s important to keep the ship afloat AND get out of the storm. Openscapes helps teams steer out of the storm of email chains with 37 versions of the same spreadsheet and to the calmer waters of open science and meaningful collaboration, using tools like R.” 
- Adyan Rios, NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center
