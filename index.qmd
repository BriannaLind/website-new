# **WHAT WE DO**
:::

<br>

**Openscapes is an approach and a movement** that helps researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct data-intensive science. Through a creative approach drawing inspiration and skills from many places, we provide structures for technical skill-building, collaborative teamwork, and inclusive community development. Here's how:

{{< fa users title="Three people" >}}
:::
::: {.blue-text .medium-body-text}
**ENGAGE**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We welcome, and create space & place.** We engage researchers who want to work better and collaborate through empathy, art, storytelling, and technology.

**EMPOWER**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We invest in learning & trust, and work openly.** We empower researchers by growing their confidence and abilities as they put what they learn into practice quickly.

**AMPLIFY**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We leverage common workflows & tools, and inspire broader shifts.** We amplify progress through collaboration and reuse, celebrating people and small wins that accumulate.

# **GROWING THE OPEN MOVEMENT**
:::
<br>
**As part of the larger open science movement**, Openscapes helps research teams and organizations reimagine data-intensive science and grow community-centered leadership skills. <!-- as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities.  We call this **kinder science for future us**. --->

<!-- START C.Nickles quote -->

> *"Openscapes has created a collaborative environment for DAAC staff to collectively support open science initiatives and develop awesome material to help Earthdata users. Perhaps just as important as what we’ve done however, are mindsets we’ve grown into along the way…We are better at dreaming and implementing the future together."*
