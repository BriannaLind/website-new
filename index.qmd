# **WHAT WE DO**
:::

<br>

**Openscapes is an approach and a movement** that helps researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct data-intensive science by providing structure for technical skill-building, collaborative teamwork, and inclusive community development. Here's how:

::: {.g-col-4}

{{< fa users title="Three people" >}}
:::
::: {.blue-text .medium-body-text}
**ENGAGE**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We welcome and create space and place.** We engage researchers who want to work better and collaborate through empathy, art, storytelling, and technology.

:::
::: {.blue-text .medium-body-text}
**EMPOWER**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We invest in learning and trust, and work openly.** We empower researchers by growing their confidence and abilities as they put what they learn into practice quickly.

:::

**AMPLIFY**
:::
:::{.medium-gray1-text .small-body-text} 
**We leverage common workflows and inspire broader shifts.** We amplify progress through collaboration and reuse, celebrating people and small wins that accumulate.

# **GROWING THE OPEN MOVEMENT**
:::
<br>
**As part of the larger open science movement**, Openscapes helps research teams and organizations reimagine data-intensive science as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. <!-- We call this **kinder science for future us**. ---> <!---Learn more about our [initiatives](initiatives.qmd) and [impact](impact.qmd), and [connect](connect.qmd) with us.--->

The text around the logo reads as follows: 'Welcome bright spots (be they mentors or researchers) -- people who want to work better and collaborate' > 'Create space and place to connect and collaborate; remove barriers to participation (paid time, part of jobs)' > 'Invest in learning and trust; Everyone has something to learn, ask, teach; don't need to be an expert in everything. Cultivate psychological safety, growth mindset. Slowing down to speed up.' > 'Work Openly; Put what you learn into practice quickly, role-modeing sharing imperfect work and identifying common challenges and opportunities. Openness is a spectrum; first Future You and then Future Us' > Leverage common workflows, skills, tools; This is where we speed up: Iterate, reuse, remix with each other and teh broader community' > 'Inspire broader scientific communities through visible examples and leaders -- Open science shift' > repeat. These six steps are summarized by three overarching goals, which are also written around the logo: 'Engage a future us mindset', 'Empower learning culture', and 'Amplify open leaders'."

“Openscapes has created a collaborative environment for DAAC staff to collectively support open science initiatives and develop awesome material to help Earthdata users. Perhaps just as important as what we’ve done however, are mindsets we’ve grown into along the way...We are better at dreaming and implementing the future together.”

**– Cassandra Nickles, NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC)**

“As fisheries scientists, we know that when we’re in rough seas, it’s important to keep the ship afloat AND get out of the storm. Openscapes helps teams steer out of the storm of email chains with 37 versions of the same spreadsheet and to the calmer waters of open science and meaningful collaboration, using tools like R.”

"Because of Openscapes, I have renewed hope in how we can bring about a kinder future in science. I see a commitment in the open science community to bridging the gaps where we’ve left members of our community behind, and it inspires me."
