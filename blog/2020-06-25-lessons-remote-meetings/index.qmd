I had the pleasure of writing a piece with Abby Cabunoc Mayes and Chad Sansing that was just published in Open Source Way called [**3 lessons from remote meetings weâ€™re taking back to the office**](https://opensource.com/article/20/6/remote-meetings). For me, this includes our scientific offices and labs.  

In this article we offer 3 lessons:

1. Set an inclusive tone
2. Provide robust documentation
3. Choose the right tools

This publication builds from a previous post, [How to run a remote workshop, Openscapes/Open Leaders-style](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/03/11/how-to-run-a-remote-workshop/) and conversations on Twitter. We have found that practices that lead to good meeting design remotely can also be used in person (or a hybrid of remote and in person) to strengthen community remotely and in real life. We wrote this piece earlier during the pandemic and it is important to emphasize that inclusion also requires deliberate efforts to be anti-racist.

Abby and Chad are colleagues from Mozilla that created the incredible [Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/online-meeting-tips/) program and also the  [Movement-Building From Home Community Calls](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/new-movement-building-home-community-calls/) to support community building during the COVID-19 global health crisis. They have been so instrumental in my personal development as an open leader, and I built the Openscapes Champions Program modeled after Open Leaders. They have also been instrumental in the lives of so many others, as they have refined and scaled the OL program, including through [OLx](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13NAGmqP_Fb2qjBKePGVZe7awtwnFKZUHtPz8mqbYtsE/present?token=AC4w5Vjf0u1Jtdi7vB3udA5O-S5wIuJuwA%3A1582781847727&includes_info_params=1&eisi=CPP7qe6B8ecCFc8OJAode38EqA#slide=id.g25275a8168_0_260).
