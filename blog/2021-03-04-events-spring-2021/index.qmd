Please join us for a conversation with [Dr. Dawn Wright](https://twitter.com/deepseadawn) about the connections between the open science movement, democratized tech, solution-driven science, and climate change.

## Partner spotlight

We are so grateful for our partners who are helping grow and improve Openscapes. Learn more about them under the [Advisors & Collaborators](/team.qmd#advisors-collaborators) section on our [Team page](/team.qmd).

[Tara Robertson](https://tararobertson.ca/) is a diversity, equity and inclusion consultant working with us to help improve our programming. Tara is an intersectional feminist who uses data and research to advocate for equality and inclusion, and she brings over 12 years experience leading change in open source technology communities, including 3 years leading Diversity and Inclusion at Mozilla.

Our work with Tara is supported by a grant from Code for Science and Society, and our focus is preparing for our Champions program in May-June. The CS&S Cohort is our first-ever “open call”, where participating groups may not have any pre-established community trust. Through our first conversations, Tara has framed [psychological safety](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/foster-psychological-safety/) as a critical piece of the trust-building, and how we can think about this through a lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

## Openscapes in the Media 

These are a few pieces that we’ve contributed to recently. 

[Supporting Open Research Communities During COVID](https://eventfund.codeforscience.org/supporting-open-research-communities-during-covid/) - _Lesack et al. 2021, Code for Science & Society_. This piece co-authored by Erin Robinson shares reflections from a discussion at the Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools ([JROST](https://investinopen.org/community/jrost-2020-conference/)) conference in December 2020. They provide three tips to guide open research communities that normally rely on in-person community-building events: for newly-launched efforts, for first-time remote events, and for downscaling due to funding constraints.  

[Openscapes embraces kindness and inclusion of open science](https://sparcopen.org/impact-story/openscapes-embraces-kindness-and-inclusion-of-open-science/) - *SPARC, 2021.* This interview with Julie Lowndes builds from her talk at the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Roundtable on [Aligning Incentives for Open Science](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/roundtable-on-aligning-incentives-for-open-science) in November 2020. It describes Openscapes as an impact story, a way to help turn open science from an idea into a daily benefit for researchers, that also welcomes them into the broader world of “open”. 

<br>

Thank you for being a part of our community. We’re really excited about all this, and more to come. 

Cheers,
Julie and Erin
