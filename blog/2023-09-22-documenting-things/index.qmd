*This week I've been at #PositConf2023 in Chicago, reconnecting with folks from RLadies, Posit, and the greater #rstats and open science community. I also gave a talk, sharing about documenting things and how intentional approaches is helping teams tackle hard challenges and change organizational culture. This post is *

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we debrief from openscapes events we have one thing we would go tell our roommate try to write that down and capture that so these are some ideas about what you would run and tell your roommate from conf.

Conference kicked off with a beautiful and inspiring video by the penobscope nation. It was narrated by a Jan Paul and told the story of pollution and water quality monitoring by the tribe. 

One of my absolute favorite talks was by Riva about growing the our Lady's community. This is the story of how a large global community has changed its leadership and upgraded its membership system in a cost-effective and code forward approach, while continuing to support the community throughout. The transition from manually entering from a Google form to switching to air table that automatically updates using a Cron job and GitHub action was very fascinating to me. The our Ladies community has not only changed individual career paths but the community as a whole. I spoke with several people who this was their first positconf who commented how many women were at this conference and how connected they were. And that is huge that is the work of so many awesome women in the early community and so many awesome allies and supporters from every aspect, including posit, who pays for the room for us to all gather at the end of the conference. I am so proud to be a part of our ladies, and while I have passed leadership of our chapter to others, I will get more involved in our ladies going forward.

I really appreciated talking with Sylvia kennilone and Millie Sims throughout the conference, Millie gave a fantastic talk about her journey becoming an observer to contributor. Hannah Frick is always a fave person to see, and is part has been part of the our Lady's global leadership for a long time. She showed me some awesome tiny verse stick socks, and later on Tracy teal gave me a pair as well.

There are new exciting features and partnerships with quarto! Mine talked about reproducible manuscripts with quarto and a new partnership with EGU to make this happen. Corto can already use hypothesis.io for commenting. Charlotte Wickham shared about code annotation,. I also spoke with JJ lair about some features that the NASA mentors are hoping for and will be following up together about that.

Web-r but you use are the two publish our in quarter documents without a server, which is huge for teaching. I'm excited to look into this more, and was so thrilled to see Eli homes from Noah fisheries acknowledged as one of the early testers

Kari Jordan's talk about black hair and data science have more in common than you think was really thought-provoking. I have a long way to go in my understanding of communities, but very created a fabulous table categorizing hair type and data type and the tools and workflows required. I watched Cher hurts talk as well and appreciated x. I love to that their niece was at the conference with them learning about our

The keynotes were all really super.
Kara Woo gave a beautiful keynote welcoming us to conf and thinking about us as walking through a garden and how to take what we pick and feel through this garden back to our home places. One quote that stood out to me was that if you're afraid of changing something cuz you think you might break something, it's already broken

Jeremy Howard's keynote was very interesting, all presented from a Jupiter notebook. I had listened to a conversation with Jeremy Howard and JJ Heller that I found really thought-provoking last year. And it's interesting to see how these ideas look on a page

Elaine McVay shared cyclical process of getting by in as a data scientist, she shared about how many times data scientists are hired within a team but not given access to data and so building relationships and showing not telling is a big part of getting by in and being able to do the job.

Ted ladaris spoke about burnout experienced by community organizers, and how asking for help not taking it all on yourself and x or strategies for continuing to find joy and learning without burning out

Sean cross talked about the tiny data tutor that he developed to help visualize tinyverse operations, and he framed this in a bigger idea that code is data, which is something I'd never heard about before. Sean cross is such a hero of mine, one of the early friendly people that made me feel like I belonged in the our community, and I'm so thrilled to be working with him more now through kyber and through Fred hutch. It was wonderful to see him in person and he gave me a swirl sticker which I have coveted for a long time

So many hallway conversations and hugs. Davis Vaughn shared about updates to deplier, and found me early to ask if I needed any help with my slides. Davis has come to the rescue at both my corto and use our keynotes to help with sharingan and corto slide formatting in the last moment of need. So appreciate him and fun fact, we first met because he saw my computer with stickers in the airport in London and came to say hi

I love talking with Andy Tucker and stuff Haslett and learning about how their work is going after leaving industry jobs, Sierra Martinez it was a Mozilla fellow with me and I got to not only meet her toddler but talk to her about really big work in biodiversity that she's doing,

No officeries Marine Mammal lab were there! This is a group I've worked with for years now and I remember first conversations with Josh London about how we could work together, and now it's happening

I got to meet yanni in person! She is the community manager at Urban side, and on the leadership team of our Ladies and very active in the carpentries. We talked about how important it is to be active across these different communities and how we collaborate and not complete, and this is something that we will continue strengthening in the years to come. She talked about all of the amazing work that are open side champions are doing and package development, and that teams often want to join together to think about package maintenance as a team. I wonder if this will be something for the NASA and Noah mentors in the future.






## Documenting things

The purpose of the talk was to give advice about how to document things effectively & share stories of how documentation can be visible and valued â€” and help teams be efficient, productive, and less lonely. I presented this in 2 parts. First, a 5-min lightning talk with practical tips, inspired by [Jenny Bryan's Naming Files](https://github.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files#how-to-name-files) ðŸ’™; Jenny has been a huge teacher, inspiration, and role model of how to documenting things and share to support others, and this is an attempt to follow suit. Second: 10-min stories with repeatable strategies, from NASA Openscapes & beyond. Something that is critical to all of this is to have technical and social infrastructure, i.e. time and support to write documentation as part of your job. There is a  [TL;DR](TODO EDITORIAL REF) in the form of a preprint editorial co-authored by Openscapes Mentors across NASA, NOAA, EPA, and academia.

Walk through the slides for the details and tips!

**Stories** 

I shared stories about growing the NASA Openscapes Mentors community, first focusing on how documenting things helped staff collaborate from across NASA Data Centers to co-develop teaching resources to support researchers using NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. Further, this documentation helped onboard others as contributors in three ways

There are 3 different quarto books, one is a project website with audience for NASA leadership; the Cookbook's audience is for Mentors; The Approach Guide is for the Openscapes Team." fig-align="center"}
