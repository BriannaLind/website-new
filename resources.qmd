## R FOR EXCEL USERS

-   [R for Excel Users](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel) Lowndes & Horst 2020
:::
:::

```{=html}
<!---
We recommend using R with RStudio, which not only provides a supportive infrastructure but enables direct connection to GitHub.com (i.e. without additional software or use of the command line). Further, workflows with RStudio's tidyverse & friends and with RMarkdown create good practices for collaborative, reproducible workflows.

## QUARTER/SEMESTER-LONG COURSES

Teaching official university courses is a great idea! These are a few examples of course materials that you can reuse as-is or adapt for your own context --- many are environmental science focused. From our experience, we don't recommend mix-and-matching between resources --- especially if this is your first time teaching. This is because there is logic and cadence to each one and trying to combine them can result in reinventing more wheels than intended. Instead, we recommend finding one that best suits you (based on length, content, or audience) and potentially adapting it to your needs.

This R-focused list is not meant to be comprehensive of all the incredible resources available; it represents a selection of material immediately useful to scientists we have worked with. It is an evolving effort and Openscapes resources are also listed below.

## WORKING COLLABORATIVELY, OPENLY, & EFFICIENTLY

Thinking deliberately about data and embracing existing open tools and workflows for science increases efficiency, broadens the scientific questions that can be asked, introduces a network of online allies outside scientific domains, and makes it easier to ask for help.

For example, the Ocean Health Index describes how open software and borrowing practices from software engineers was game-changing for collaborative coding and communication.

## JOINING & BUILDING LEARNING COMMUNITIES

Learning to code should be fun since you are learning powerful and empowering tools that will be game-changing for your science. So learn with friends, and grow your community.

## R WITH RSTUDIO & GITHUB

We recommend using R with RStudio, which not only provides a supportive infrastructure but enables direct connection to GitHub.com (i.e. without additional software or use of the command line). Further, workflows with RStudio's tidyverse & friends and with RMarkdown create good practices for collaborative, reproducible workflows.
